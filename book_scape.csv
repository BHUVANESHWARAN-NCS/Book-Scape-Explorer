69IyAgAAQBAJ,history,"Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, revised and expanded edition",,John V. Guttag,MIT Press,"An introductory text that teaches students the art of computational problem solving, covering topics that range from simple algorithms to information visualization. This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming.

This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, The way of the program.

This book is ideal for readers with some Python programming experience. The book covers key language concepts that must be understood to program effectively, especially for data analysis applications. Certain low-level language features are discussed in detail, especially Python memory management and data structures. Using Python effectively means taking advantage of its vast ecosystem. The book discusses Python package management and how to use third-party modules as well as how to structure your own Python modules. The section on object-oriented programming explains features of the language that facilitate common programming patterns. After developing the key Python language features, the book moves on to third-party modules that are foundational for effective data analysis, starting with Numpy. The book develops key Numpy concepts and discusses internal Numpy array data structures and memory usage. Then, the author moves onto Pandas and details its many features for data processing and alignment. Because strong visualizations are important for communicating data analysis, key modules such as Matplotlib are developed in detail, along with web-based options such as Bokeh, Holoviews, Altair, and Plotly. The text is sprinkled with many tricks-of-the-trade that help avoid common pitfalls. The author explains the internal logic embodied in the Python language so that readers can get into the Python mindset and make better design choices in their codes, which is especially helpful for newcomers to both Python and data analysis.

vr05swEACAAJ,history,A Byte of Python,"""A Byte of Python"" Is a Free Book on Programming Using the Python Language. If All You Know about Computers Is How to Save Text Files, Then This Is the Book for You.","C. H. C H Swaroop, James Zimmerhoff",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,"The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, [1] and its implementation was started in December 1989[2] by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC (programming language) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[3] Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).[4][5] Python was named for the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.[6] Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.[7] Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008[8] after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.[9] In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.[10] Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of list, dict, str and so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as ""one of Python's major programming units.""[1] Python's exception model also resembles Modula-3's, with the addition of an else clause.[3] In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python's userbase.[1] Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce. Van Rossum stated that ""Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches.""[11] The last version released while Van Rossum was at CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Van Rossum continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia whence he released several versions. By version 1.4, Python had acquired several new features. Notable among these are the Modula-3 inspired keyword arguments (which are also similar to Common Lisp's keyword arguments) and built-in support for complex numbers. Also included is a basic form of data hiding by name mangling, though this is easily bypassed.[12] During Van Rossum's stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic ""literacy"" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E's goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA.[13] As of 2007, the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, reaching out to non-programmers is not an active concern.[14] Here are what people are saying about the book: This is the best beginner's tutorial I've ever seen!

gA9QDwAAQBAJ,history,The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference,,Terence Parr,Pragmatic Bookshelf,"Programmers run into parsing problems all the time. Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor. This book is your ticket to becoming a parsing guru! What You Need: ANTLR 4.0 and above. Java development tools.

HTozEAAAQBAJ,history,IronPython in Action,,"Christian J. Muirhead, Michael Foord",Simon and Schuster,"In 2005, Microsoft quietly announced an initiative to bring dynamic languages to the .NET platform. The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework. IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming. IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it's a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and duck typing , metaprogramming, and more. IronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors provide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning.

BtNMDwAAQBAJ,history,Understanding Optics with Python,,"Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan, Hassen Ghalila, Ahmed Ammar, L. Srinivasa Varadharajan",CRC Press,"Optics is an enabling science that forms a basis for our technological civilization. Courses in optics are a required part of the engineering or physics undergraduate curriculum in many universities worldwide. The aim of Understanding Optics with Python is twofold: first, to describe certain basic ideas of classical physical and geometric optics; second, to introduce the reader to computer simulations of physical phenomena. The text is aimed more broadly for those who wish to use numerical/computational modeling as an educational tool that promotes interactive teaching (and learning). In addition, it offers an alternative to developing countries where the necessary equipment to carry out the appropriate experiments is not available as a result of financial constraints. This approach contributes to a better diffusion of knowledge about optics. The examples given in this book are comparable to those found in standard textbooks on optics and are suitable for self-study. This text enables the user to study and understand optics using hands-on simulations with Python. Python is our programming language of choice because of its open-source availability, extensive functionality, and an enormous online support. Essentials of programming in Python 3.x, including graphical user interface, are also provided. The codes in the book are available for download on the book’s website. Discusses most standard topics of traditional physical and geometrical optics through Python and PyQt5 Provides visualizations and in-depth descriptions of Python’s programming language and simulations Includes simulated laboratories where students are provided a ""hands-on"" exploration of Python software Coding and programming featured within the text are available for download on the book’s corresponding website. ""Understanding Optics with Python by Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan, Hassen Ghalila, Ahmed Ammar, and L. Srinivasa Varadharajan is born around a nice idea: using simulations to provide the students with a powerful tool to understand and master optical phenomena. The choice of the Python language is perfectly matched with the overall goal of the book, as the Python language provides a completely free and easy-to-learn platform with huge cross-platform compatibility, where the reader of the book can conduct his or her own numerical experiments to learn faster and better."" — Costantino De Angelis, University of Brescia, Italy ""Teaching an important programming language like Python through concrete examples from optics is a natural and, in my view, very effective approach. I believe that this book will be used by students and appreciated greatly by instructors. The topic of modelling optical effects and systems where the students should already have a physical background provides great motivation for students to learn the basics of a powerful programming language without the intimidation factor that often goes with a formal computer science course."" — John Dudley, FEMTO-ST Institute, Besançon, France","9781351648844, 1351648845",True,True,342,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BtNMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

gSFYYKbtDCsC,history,Monty Python's Flying Circus,"An Utterly Complete, Thoroughly Unillustrated, Absolutely Unauthorized Guide to Possibly All the References : from Arthur ""Two-Sheds"" Jackson to Zambesi",Darl Larsen,Rowman & Littlefield,"In 1969, the BBC aired the first episode of a new comedy series titled Monty Python's Flying Circus, and the rest, as they say, is history. An instant success, the show ran until 1974, producing a total of 45 episodes. Despite the show's very English humor and allusions to many things British, the series developed a cult following outside the U.K., particularly in the United States. Known for its outrageous humor, occasionally controversial content, and often silly spirit, Monty Python's Flying Circus poked fun at nearly all institutions--domestic or foreign, grand or intimate, sacred or not. Indeed, many of the allusions and references in the program were uniquely British and routinely obscure, and therefore, not always understood or even noticed outside the British Isles. This exhaustive reference identifies and explains the plethora of cultural, historical, and topical allusions of this landmark series. In this resource, virtually every allusion and reference that appeared in an episode--whether stated by a character, depicted in the mise-en-scene, or mentioned in the printed scripts--is identified and explained. Organized chronologically by episode, each entry is listed alphabetically, indicates what sketch it appeared in, and is cross-referenced between episodes. Entries cover literary and metaphoric allusions, symbolisms, names, peoples, and places; as well as the myriad social, cultural, and historical elements (photos, songs, slogans, caricatures) that populate and inform these episodes. Entries Include: -""Arabella Plunkett"" -Group of famous characters from famous paintings -Hell's Grannies -HRH The Dummy Princess Margaret -""Kandinsky"" -""On the Dad's Liver Bachelors at Large"" -Raymond Baxter type -Scun -""Spanish Inquisition"" -""Third Parachute Brigade Amateur Dramatic Society"" -""total cashectomy"" -""Two-Sheds"" -""Umbonga's hostile opening"" -Vicar sitting thin and unhappy in a pot -""What's all this then?""","9780810861312, 0810861313",False,True,576,Monty Python's flying circus (Television program),en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gSFYYKbtDCsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2008

I just wished I could remember what actually went on then."" --Terry Jones ""If anyone can remember more about making the Life of Brian than me, it's Kim ‘Howard' Johnson. He came, he saw, he got into costume. While the rest of us were fighting to upstage each other, Howard had a notebook hidden in his toga."" --Michael Palin ""Since I've forgotten everything, it will be great to read what was actually going on in Tunisia. Just as long as I'm the most quoted, the most vital to the shooting, and the most interesting. You don't have to mention my stunning good looks if you don't want to."" --Terry Gilliam ""Of all the books that I am planning to read in my dotage, there is none I am more looking forward to than Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday. . . . Not only does ‘Howard' Johnson know more about Python than anyone outside of the IRS, he was in Tunisia for most of the filming of Life of Brian, and is the only person who captured every thoughtless remark, heated exchange, embarrassing detail, petty insult, and spiteful act of indifference."" --John Cleese ""Kim ‘Howard' Johnson was invented by Graham Chapman during an idle moment on the set of The Life of Brian. ‘Let's invent a person,' he said. ‘An American fan from the Midwest,' chimed in Michael Palin, ‘who keeps a daily diary of Python filming. And then doesn't publish it for years and years.' How we laughed, and each day we'd make up stuff this ‘person' would write about us."" --Eric Idle In 1978, Kim ""Howard"" Johnson ran away to join the circus---Monty Python's Flying Circus, that is. The Pythons converged on Tunisia to film their timeless classic, Life of Brian, and Howard found himself in the thick of it, doubling for nearly all the Pythons, playing more roles in the film than John Cleese, and managing to ruin only one shot. He became the unit journalist, substitute still photographer, Roman soldier, peasant, Biggus Dickus's double, near-stalker, and, ultimately, friend and confidant of the comedy legends. He also kept a detailed journal of what he saw and heard, on set and off, throughout those six weeks. The result is a unique eyewitness account that reveals the Pythons at work and at play in a way that nothing else written about them could do. Now, for the first time ever, the inside story of the making of the film is revealed through the fly-on-the-castle-wall perspective. Even the most diehard fans will get a fresh take on the comedy greats through some never-before-revealed nuggets of Python brilliance: what John Cleese offered to exchange for suntan lotion; Terry Jones directing in drag; Michael Palin's secret to playing revolutionaries and peasants; Graham Chapman gets naked; Terry Gilliam gets filthy; Eric Idle haggles; the secret of the Thespo-Squat; Mrs. Pilate; talk of George Harrison; the cake-flinging that jeopardized the production; badminton, impromptu cricket, and erotic frescoes; and the first-ever presentation of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" Here, uncensored, are the legendary Pythons in their prime. It was a period of comedy history that will never be duplicated, and Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday captures the wit, the genius, and the sheer silliness of the six men that comprised Python.","9781429994255, 1429994258",True,False,443,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8f2fIhvDx98C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2024

Shot in the Middle East and produced during Margaret Thatcher’s ascendant years, the film satirized—among other matters—authoritarianism and religious zealotry. Upon its release, Monty Python’s Life of Brian was both a critical and commercial success, and has been since hailed as one of the greatest comedies of all time. But the film also faced backlash from religious groups for its blasphemy, perceived or otherwise. In A Book about the Film Monty Python's Life of Brian: All of the References from Assyrians to Zeffirelli, Darl Larsen identifies and examines the plethora of cultural, historical, and topical allusions in the film. In this resource, Larsen delineates virtually every allusion and reference that appears in the film—from first-century Jerusalem through 1970s Great Britain. Organized chronologically by scene, the entries in this cultural history cover literary and metaphoric allusions, symbolisms, names, peoples, and places, as well as the many social, cultural, and historical elements that populate this film. By closely examining each scene, this book explores the Pythons’ comparisons of the Roman and British Empires and of Pilate and Margaret Thatcher. In addition, Larsen helps to situate Life of Brian in the “Jesus” re-examination of the postwar period, while also taking a close look at the terror groups of first-century Judea and the modern world. A Book about the Film Monty Python's Life of Brian will appeal to scholars of history, film, British culture, and pop culture, as well as to the many fans of this iconic group.","9781538103661, 1538103664",True,True,497,Performing Arts,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fjxCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

F-Q_EAAAQBAJ,history,Smart Log Data Analytics,Techniques for Advanced Security Analysis,"Florian Skopik, Markus Wurzenberger, Max Landauer",Springer Nature,"This book provides insights into smart ways of computer log data analysis, with the goal of spotting adversarial actions. It is organized into 3 major parts with a total of 8 chapters that include a detailed view on existing solutions, as well as novel techniques that go far beyond state of the art. The first part of this book motivates the entire topic and highlights major challenges, trends and design criteria for log data analysis approaches, and further surveys and compares the state of the art. The second part of this book introduces concepts that apply character-based, rather than token-based, approaches and thus work on a more fine-grained level. Furthermore, these solutions were designed for “online use”, not only forensic analysis, but also process new log lines as they arrive in an efficient single pass manner. An advanced method for time series analysis aims at detecting changes in the overall behavior profile of an observed system and spotting trends and periodicities through log analysis. The third part of this book introduces the design of the AMiner, which is an advanced open source component for log data anomaly mining. The AMiner comes with several detectors to spot new events, new parameters, new correlations, new values and unknown value combinations and can run as stand-alone solution or as sensor with connection to a SIEM solution. More advanced detectors help to determines the characteristics of variable parts of log lines, specifically the properties of numerical and categorical fields. Detailed examples throughout this book allow the reader to better understand and apply the introduced techniques with open source software. Step-by-step instructions help to get familiar with the concepts and to better comprehend their inner mechanisms. A log test data set is available as free download and enables the reader to get the system up and running in no time. This book is designed for researchers working in the field of cyber security, and specifically system monitoring, anomaly detection and intrusion detection. The content of this book will be particularly useful for advanced-level students studying computer science, computer technology, and information systems.

NZP6AQAAQBAJ,history,Machine Learning,A Probabilistic Perspective,Kevin P. Murphy,MIT Press,"A comprehensive introduction to machine learning that uses probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package—PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)—that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.","9780262018029, 0262018020",False,True,1102,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZP6AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2012

vqTfNFDzzdIC,history,Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture,,Martin Fowler,Addison-Wesley,"The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them. The topics covered include · Dividing an enterprise application into layers · The major approaches to organizing business logic · An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases · Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation · Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions · Designing distributed object interfaces","9780133065213, 0133065219",True,True,558,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vqTfNFDzzdIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,8,3,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3350.82,INR,3350.82,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vqTfNFDzzdIC&rdid=book-vqTfNFDzzdIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2012

rIL9swEACAAJ,history,A Smarter Way to Learn Python,Learn It Faster. Remember It Longer,Mark Myers,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,"I designed a learning system for myself that quadrupled my aptitude for learning computer languages. It worked so well for me that I've used it to teach coding to grandmothers, cab drivers, musicians, and 50,000 other newbies. Washington University research shows that a key teaching method I use--interactive recall practice--improves learning performance 400 percent. Computer languages are not inherently hard to understand, even for non-techies. Remembering is the problem. Research shows that you will remember everything if you're repeatedly asked to recall it. That's the beauty of flash cards. But technology offers an even better way to make information stick. With my book you get almost a thousand interactive exercises--they're free online--that embed the whole book in your memory. Algorithms check your work to make sure you know what you think you know. When you stumble, you do the exercise again. You keep trying until you know the chapter cold. The exercises keep you engaged, give you extra practice where you're shaky, and prepare you for each next step. Every lesson is built on top of a solid foundation that you and I have carefully constructed. Each individual step is small. But all the little steps add up to real knowledge--knowledge that you retain. You don't need to be a computer genius to learn Python.

The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs—in companies of all sizes—a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.","9780307887894, 0307887898",False,False,337,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r9x-OXdzpPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,4,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2011

_la8zgEACAAJ,history,Coding,6 BOOKS in 1 : Linux for Beginners - PYTHON (2) - SQL - HTML - C++ PROGRAMMING,"Michael Clark, Michael Learn",,"Do you want to learn Computer Programming ?? ◆★★INCLUDES 6 MANUSCRIPTS★★◆ ★LEARN PYTHON PROGRAMMING★ In today''s Industry, Python Programming is highly recommended for developing Websites. The creator of this programming language was Guido Van Rossum, released first in the year 1991. The multiple supporting programming paradigms made itself unique from other programming languages as it had some outstanding features like unique adaptability, the ability to adopt machine learning, scientific computation, cloud infrastructure and above all web development. Python''s role is really commendable in both software development, as well as, web development. ★PYTHON CODING AND PROGRAMMING★ Python is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook. It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc., and those languages hire Python designs for their development. ★LINUX FOR BEGINNERS★ For computers, servers, mainframes, mobile, and embedded devices, Linux is an open-source and community-developed and operating system. As it is an open source OS, the code is free to create Linux. That''s why the appropriate skills for the users are necessary, even if they are beginners, so that they can get the best out of the operating system. This is not only used by the web programmers but also by the regular computer or laptop users and even mobile phones. Get hold of the eBook to learn more. As it is a bit different from the popular operating system like Windows or Android, it takes a little bit of time to get the hang of it. ★SQL★ The truth is: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Many people scoff dubiously when it is announced that SQL is, indeed, a programming language. When people think of programming languages, all that comes to their mind are C++, Python, Java etc, People disregard SQL as a programming language because of its interface structure and limited functionality. However, they fail to understand that while C++, Python are third level programming languages, and hence more developed, it doesn''t change the fact that SQL falls under the umbrella of programming languages. ★HTML★ HTML is changing so quickly it''s practically difficult to stay aware of improvements. XHTML is HTML 4.0 revised in XML; it gives the exactness of XML while holding the adaptability of HTML. HTML and XHTML: The Definitive Guide, Fourth Edition, unites everything. It''s the most exhaustive book accessible on HTML and XHTML today. It covers Netscape Navigator 6.0, Internet Explorer 5.0, HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, JavaScript, Style sheets, Layers, and the entirety of the highlights upheld by the mainstream internet browsers. ★C++★ C++ is an object orientated computer language created by remarkable computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as a part of the evolution of the C family of languages. A few call C++ ""C with Classes"" because it introduces object orientated programming principles, including using defined classes, to C program language period framework.

PVvtdxosLYYC,history,New Europe,,Michael Palin,Hachette UK,"No. 1 bestseller and superstar doing what he does best, introducing millions of avid readers to little-known peoples and places. Until the early 1990s, when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, travelling behind the iron curtain was never easy. In undertaking his new journey through Eastern Europe, breathing in its rich history, and exquisite sights and talking to its diverse peoples, Michael fills what has been a void in his own experience and that of very many others. NEW EUROPE is very much a voyage of discovery, from the snows of the Julian Alps to the beauty of the Baltic sea, he finds himself in countries he'd barely heard of, many unfamiliar and mysterious, all with tragic histories and much brighter futures. During his 20-country adventure Palin meets Romanian lumberjacks, drives the 8.58 stopping train from Poznan to Wolsztyn, treads the catwalk at a Budapest fashion show, learns about mine-clearing in Bosnia and watches Turkish gents wrestling in olive oil. As with all his bestselling books, in his uniquely entertaining style, Palin opens up a new and undiscovered world to millions of readers.","9780297863618, 0297863614",True,False,335,Travel,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PVvtdxosLYYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,600.62,INR,300.31,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PVvtdxosLYYC&rdid=book-PVvtdxosLYYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2010

Wws0AAAAMAAJ,history,Pretending and Meaning,Toward a Pragmatic Theory of Fictional Discourse,Richard Henry,Praeger,"Since Plato, Western critics of literature have asked how it is possible for fiction writers to mean something serious. The outrage over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, published in 1988, highlighted our continued uneasiness over distinctions between fact and fiction, novel and history, truth and falsehood. The blasphemy charged against Rushdie raises important questions: Did Rushdie mean The Satanic Verses, or didn't he? When he publicly recanted, what did he mean? What do we even mean by mean? This is the starting point for Richard Henry's fascinating investigation of the pragmatic foundations of fictional discourse. Drawing from Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature, Henry offers a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts. Pretending and Meaning: Toward a Pragmatic Theory of Fictional Discourse draws upon Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature to offer a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts.",UOM:39015037768341,False,False,152,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wws0AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1996

For those who want to get started right away, the book is accompanied by a dedicated Web page and a Github repository that includes all the code from the book for easy replication and use, as well as a hosted version of all the code for immediate execution. Python is fast making inroads into financial modelling and derivatives analytics, and recent developments allow Python to be as fast as pure C++ or C while consisting generally of only 10% of the code lines associated with the compiled languages. This complete guide offers rare insight into the use of Python to undertake complex quantitative analyses of listed volatility and variance derivatives. Learn how to use Python for data and financial analysis, and reproduce stylised facts on volatility and variance markets Gain an understanding of the fundamental techniques of modelling volatility and variance and the model-free replication of variance Familiarise yourself with micro structure elements of the markets for listed volatility and variance derivatives Reproduce all results and graphics with IPython/Jupyter Notebooks and Python codes that accompany the book Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives is the complete guide to Python-based quantitative analysis of these Eurex derivatives products.","9781119167938, 1119167930",True,True,398,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gpB6DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,10509.08,INR,10509.08,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpB6DQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-gpB6DQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016
JOTzswEACAAJ,history,Python Testing with Pytest,"Simple, Rapid, Effective, and Scalable",Brian Okken,,"Do less work when testing your Python code, but be just as expressive, just as elegant, and just as readable. The pytest testing framework helps you write tests quickly and keep them readable and maintainable - with no boilerplate code. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it's just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing for applications, packages, and libraries. This book shows you how. For Python-based projects, pytest is the undeniable choice to test your code if you're looking for a full-featured, API-independent, flexible, and extensible testing framework. With a full-bodied fixture model that is unmatched in any other tool, the pytest framework gives you powerful features such as assert rewriting and plug-in capability - with no boilerplate code. With simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn and robust tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing. Add powerful testing features and still speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use the built-in assert statements to reduce false test failures by separating setup and test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, unittest, and doctest. Write simple, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing and why. What You Need: The examples in this book are written using Python 3.6 and pytest 3.0. However, pytest 3.0 supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and Python 3.3-3.6.","1680502840, 9781680502848",False,False,222,Computer software,en,,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2017

ZwbgAAAAMAAJ,history,"Snakes in Myth, Magic, and History",The Story of a Human Obsession,Diane Morgan,Praeger,"The snake is one of humankind's most powerful and ambiguous symbols: it has at various times represented immortality and death, male and female, deity and demon, circle and line, killer and healer, the highest wisdom and the deepest subconscious. By virtue of its mysterious movement, potent poison, fearful grip, unblinking gaze and lightning quick strike, the power and image of the snake has wound its way into every culture. Whether snakes are worshipped as gods, feared as devils, or handled in religious ceremonies to test faith, snakes have played a critical role in the human heritage. This book explores the cult of the snake in world history, religion, and folklore. Fascination with snakes has been around since the dawn of time. Even today, images of snakes attract attention, fear, disgust, or admiration. Morgan examines that obsession with this mysterious creature, covering in vivid details such topics as mythical snakes like the Plumed Serpent, serpent iconography, tall tales, as well as the psychological symbolism that has attached itself to snakes. Cultures as diverse as pre-Columbian America, India, Egypt, China, sub-Saharan Africa, Celtic Europe, and the United States have all accorded the serpent a special place in their culture—apparently regardless of whether or not real snakes play an important part in the life of the people. Here, the mysterious nature of the snake unfolds, enchanting readers with a colorful and lively discussion of its place in our history, stories, religions, and cultures.",IND:30000122490406,False,False,216,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZwbgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2008

XxnZrQEACAAJ,history,R for Marketing Research and Analytics,,"Chris Chapman, Elea McDonnell Feit",Springer,"This book is a complete introduction to the power of R for marketing research practitioners. The text describes statistical models from a conceptual point of view with a minimal amount of mathematics, presuming only an introductory knowledge of statistics. Hands-on chapters accelerate the learning curve by asking readers to interact with R from the beginning. Core topics include the R language, basic statistics, linear modeling, and data visualization, which is presented throughout as an integral part of analysis. Later chapters cover more advanced topics yet are intended to be approachable for all analysts. These sections examine logistic regression, customer segmentation, hierarchical linear modeling, market basket analysis, structural equation modeling, and conjoint analysis in R. The text uniquely presents Bayesian models with a minimally complex approach, demonstrating and explaining Bayesian methods alongside traditional analyses for analysis of variance, linear models, and metric and choice-based conjoint analysis. With its emphasis on data visualization, model assessment, and development of statistical intuition, this book provides guidance for any analyst looking to develop or improve skills in R for marketing applications.","3319144359, 9783319144351",False,False,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxnZrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2015

MNF9swEACAAJ,history,Python Tutorial,Release 3.6.4,"Guido van Rossum, Python Development Team",,"The Python Tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https: //www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. For a description of standard objects and modules, see library-index. reference-index gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read extending-index and c-api-index. There are also several books covering Python in depth. This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language's flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in library-index.","1680921606, 9781680921601",False,False,156,,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MNF9swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

cBdIEAAAQBAJ,history,The Hardware Hacking Handbook,Breaking Embedded Security with Hardware Attacks,"Jasper van Woudenberg, Colin O'Flynn",No Starch Press,"The Hardware Hacking Handbook takes you deep inside embedded devices to show how different kinds of attacks work, then guides you through each hack on real hardware. Embedded devices are chip-size microcomputers small enough to be included in the structure of the object they control, and they’re everywhere—in phones, cars, credit cards, laptops, medical equipment, even critical infrastructure. This means understanding their security is critical. The Hardware Hacking Handbook takes you deep inside different types of embedded systems, revealing the designs, components, security limits, and reverse-engineering challenges you need to know for executing effective hardware attacks. Written with wit and infused with hands-on lab experiments, this handbook puts you in the role of an attacker interested in breaking security to do good. Starting with a crash course on the architecture of embedded devices, threat modeling, and attack trees, you’ll go on to explore hardware interfaces, ports and communication protocols, electrical signaling, tips for analyzing firmware images, and more. Along the way, you’ll use a home testing lab to perform fault-injection, side-channel (SCA), and simple and differential power analysis (SPA/DPA) attacks on a variety of real devices, such as a crypto wallet. The authors also share insights into real-life attacks on embedded systems, including Sony’s PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and Philips Hue lights, and provide an appendix of the equipment needed for your hardware hacking lab – like a multimeter and an oscilloscope – with options for every type of budget. You’ll learn: How to model security threats, using attacker profiles, assets, objectives, and countermeasures Electrical basics that will help you understand communication interfaces, signaling, and measurement How to identify injection points for executing clock, voltage, electromagnetic, laser, and body-biasing fault attacks, as well as practical injection tips How to use timing and power analysis attacks to extract passwords and cryptographic keys Techniques for leveling up both simple and differential power analysis, from practical measurement tips to filtering, processing, and visualization Whether you’re an industry engineer tasked with understanding these attacks, a student starting out in the field, or an electronics hobbyist curious about replicating existing work, The Hardware Hacking Handbook is an indispensable resource – one you’ll always want to have onhand.","9781593278748, 1593278748",False,False,514,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cBdIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2021

Rob is a self-taught software developer (like so many) and for most of his career he learned what was required to get the job done. When conversations veered toward core concepts, he disengaged. Rob decided to change all of this in 2014. He sat down and looked up all of the topics that a typical CS degree covers and then dove in.

VS0zEAAAQBAJ,history,C++ for Programmers,,Leen Ammeraal,John Wiley & Sons,"One of the attractive aspects of C++ is that it offers good facilities for object-oriented programming (OOP), but, as a hybrid language, it also supports procedural programming. The significance of this for programmers is that it offers more flexibility allowing them to shift to object-oriented programming if and when they feel the need to do so. In this regard, C++ differs from some purely object-oriented languages, such as Smalltalk, Eiffel and Java. This book offers practical guidance on how to programme in both styles. The C++ language and its standard library have gone through a good many improvements and extensions during their evolution. This third edition has therefore been completely revised in accordance with the C++ language revision, which is embodied in the ANSI/ISO C++ Standard.

No prior experience of writing microservices in Python is assumed.What You Will Learn* Explore what microservices are and how to design them* Use Python 3, Flask, Tox, and other tools to build your services using best practices* Learn how to use a TDD approach* Discover how to document your microservices* Configure and package your code in the best way* Interact with other services* Secure, monitor, and scale your services* Deploy your services in Docker containers, CoreOS, and Amazon Web ServicesIn DetailWe often deploy our web applications into the cloud, and our code needs to interact with many third-party services. An efficient way to build applications to do this is through microservices architecture. But, in practice, it's hard to get this right due to the complexity of all the pieces interacting with each other.This book will teach you how to overcome these issues and craft applications that are built as small standard units, using all the proven best practices and avoiding the usual traps. It's a practical book: you'll build everything using Python 3 and its amazing tooling ecosystem. You will understand the principles of TDD and apply them.You will use Flask, Tox, and other tools to build your services using best practices. You will learn how to secure connections between services, and how to script Nginx using Lua to build web application firewall features such as rate limiting. You will also familiarize yourself with Docker's role in microservices, and use Docker containers, CoreOS, and Amazon Web Services to deploy your services.This book will take you on a journey, ending with the creation of a complete Python application based on microservices. By the end of the book, you will be well versed with the fundamentals of building, designing, testing, and deploying your Python microservices.Style and approachThis book is an linear, easy-to-follow guide on how to best design, write, test, and deploy your microservices. It includes real-world examples that will help Python developers create their own Python microservice using the most efficient methods.","1785881116, 9781785881114",False,False,340,Python (Computer program language),en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zzaltAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2017
