       "     'description': 'Python’s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren’t using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python’s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time. Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3. This book covers: Python data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects Data structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age Functions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns Object-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance Control flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages Metaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work',\n",

In the first half of the book, you’ll learn about basic programming concepts, such as lists, dictionaries, classes, and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. You’ll also learn how to make your programs interactive and how to test your code safely before adding it to a project. In the second half of the book, you’ll put your new knowledge into practice with three substantial projects: a Space Invaders–inspired arcade game, data visualizations with Python’s super-handy libraries, and a simple web app you can deploy online. As you work through Python Crash Course you’ll learn how to: –Use powerful Python libraries and tools, including matplotlib, NumPy, and Pygal –Make 2D games that respond to keypresses and mouse clicks, and that grow more difficult as the game progresses –Work with data to generate interactive visualizations –Create and customize Web apps and deploy them safely online –Deal with mistakes and errors so you can solve your own programming problems If you’ve been thinking seriously about digging into programming, Python Crash Course will get you up to speed and have you writing real programs fast. Why wait any longer? Start your engines and code! Uses Python 2 and 3',\n",

       "     'description': \"Portable, powerful, and a breeze to use, Python is ideal for both standalone programs and scripting applications. With this hands-on book, you can master the fundamentals of the core Python language quickly and efficiently, whether you're new to programming or just new to Python. Once you finish, you will know enough about the language to use it in any application domain you choose. Learning Python is based on material from author Mark Lutz's popular training courses, which he's taught over the past decade. Each chapter is a self-contained lesson that helps you thoroughly understand a key component of Python before you continue. Along with plenty of annotated examples, illustrations, and chapter summaries, every chapter also contains Brain Builder, a unique section with practical exercises and review quizzes that let you practice new skills and test your understanding as you go. This book covers: Types and Operations -- Python's major built-in object types in depth: numbers, lists, dictionaries, and more Statements and Syntax -- the code you type to create and process objects in Python, along with Python's general syntax model Functions -- Python's basic procedural tool for structuring and reusing code Modules -- packages of statements, functions, and other tools organized into larger components Classes and OOP -- Python's optional object-oriented programming tool for structuring code for customization and reuse Exceptions and Tools -- exception handling model and statements, plus a look at development tools for writing larger programs Learning Python gives you a deep and complete understanding of the language that will help you comprehend any application-level examples of Python that you later encounter. If you're ready to discover what Google and YouTube see in Python, this book is the best way to get started.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'For many researchers, Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Several resources exist for individual pieces of this data science stack, but only with the Python Data Science Handbook do you get them all—IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and other related tools. Working scientists and data crunchers familiar with reading and writing Python code will find this comprehensive desk reference ideal for tackling day-to-day issues: manipulating, transforming, and cleaning data; visualizing different types of data; and using data to build statistical or machine learning models. Quite simply, this is the must-have reference for scientific computing in Python. With this handbook, you’ll learn how to use: IPython and Jupyter: provide computational environments for data scientists using Python NumPy: includes the ndarray for efficient storage and manipulation of dense data arrays in Python Pandas: features the DataFrame for efficient storage and manipulation of labeled/columnar data in Python Matplotlib: includes capabilities for a flexible range of data visualizations in Python Scikit-Learn: for efficient and clean Python implementations of the most important and established machine learning algorithms',\n",

Now, leading Python programmer Mark Summerfield demonstrates how to write code that takes full advantage of Python 3’s features and idioms. Programming in Python 3, Second Edition, brings together all the knowledge you need to write any program, use any standard or third-party Python 3 library, and create new library modules of your own. Summerfield draws on his many years of Python experience to share deep insights into Python 3 development you won’t find anywhere else. He begins by illuminating Python’s “beautiful heart”: the eight key elements of Python you need to write robust, high-performance programs. Building on these core elements, he introduces new topics designed to strengthen your practical expertise–one concept and hands-on example at a time. Coverage includes Developing in Python using procedural, objectoriented, and functional programming paradigms Creating custom packages and modules Writing and reading binary, text, and XML files, including optional compression, random access, and text and XML parsing Leveraging advanced data types, collections, control structures, and functions Spreading program workloads across multiple processes and threads Programming SQL databases and key—value DBM files Debugging techniques–and using Test Driven Development to avoid bugs in the first place Utilizing Python’s regular expression mini-language and module Parsing techniques, including how to use the third-party PyParsing and PLY modules Building usable, efficient, GUI-based applications Advanced programming techniques, including generators, function and class decorators, context managers, descriptors, abstract base classes, metaclasses, coroutines, and more Programming in Python 3, Second Edition, serves as both tutorial and language reference. It assumes some prior programming experience, and it is accompanied by extensive downloadable example code–all of it tested with Python 3 on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.',\n",

This book presents an intuitive approach to the concepts of Python Programming for students. This book differs from traditional texts not only in its philosophy but also in its overall focus, level of activities, development of topics, and attention to programming details. The contents of the book are chosen with utmost care after analyzing the syllabus for Python course prescribed by various top universities in USA, Europe, and Asia. Since the prerequisite know-how varies significantly from student to student, the book’s overall overture addresses the challenges of teaching and learning of students which is fine-tuned by the authors’ experience with large sections of students. This book uses natural language expressions instead of the traditional shortened words of the programming world. This book has been written with the goal to provide students with a textbook that can be easily understood and to make a connection between what students are learning and how they may apply that knowledge. Features of this book This book does not assume any previous programming experience, although of course, any exposure to other programming languages is useful This book introduces all of the key concepts of Python programming language with helpful illustrations Programming examples are presented in a clear and consistent manner Each line of code is numbered and explained in detail Use of f-strings throughout the book Hundreds of real-world examples are included and they come from fields such as entertainment, sports, music and environmental studies Students can periodically check their progress with in-chapter quizzes that appear in all chapters',\n",

       "     'description': 'Python Packages introduces Python packaging at an introductory and practical level that’s suitable for those with no previous packaging experience. Despite this, the text builds up to advanced topics such as automated testing, creating documentation, versioning and updating a package, and implementing continuous integration and deployment. Covering the entire Python packaging life cycle, this essential guide takes readers from package creation all the way to effective maintenance and updating. Python Packages focuses on the use of current and best-practice packaging tools and services like poetry, cookiecutter, pytest, sphinx, GitHub, and GitHub Actions. Features: The book’s source code is available online as a GitHub repository where it is collaborated on, automatically tested, and built in real time as changes are made; demonstrating the use of good reproducible and clear project workflows. Covers not just the process of creating a package, but also how to document it, test it, publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI), and how to properly version and update it. All concepts in the book are demonstrated using examples. Readers can follow along, creating their own Python packages using the reproducible code provided in the text. Focuses on a modern approach to Python packaging with emphasis on automating and streamlining the packaging process using new and emerging tools such as poetry and GitHub Actions.',\n",

       "     'description': 'Best-selling author Al Sweigart shows you how to easily build over 80 fun programs with minimal code and maximum creativity. If you’ve mastered basic Python syntax and you’re ready to start writing programs, you’ll find The Big Book of Small Python Projects both enlightening and fun. This collection of 81 Python projects will have you making digital art, games, animations, counting pro- grams, and more right away. Once you see how the code works, you’ll practice re-creating the programs and experiment by adding your own custom touches. These simple, text-based programs are 256 lines of code or less. And whether it’s a vintage screensaver, a snail-racing game, a clickbait headline generator, or animated strands of DNA, each project is designed to be self-contained so you can easily share it online. You’ll create: • Hangman, Blackjack, and other games to play against your friends or the computer • Simulations of a forest fire, a million dice rolls, and a Japanese abacus • Animations like a virtual fish tank, a rotating cube, and a bouncing DVD logo screensaver • A first-person 3D maze game • Encryption programs that use ciphers like ROT13 and Vigenère to conceal text If you’re tired of standard step-by-step tutorials, you’ll love the learn-by-doing approach of The Big Book of Small Python Projects. It’s proof that good things come in small programs!',\n",

       "     'description': \"While Excel remains ubiquitous in the business world, recent Microsoft feedback forums are full of requests to include Python as an Excel scripting language. In fact, it's the top feature requested. What makes this combination so compelling? In this hands-on guide, Felix Zumstein--creator of xlwings, a popular open source package for automating Excel with Python--shows experienced Excel users how to integrate these two worlds efficiently. Excel has added quite a few new capabilities over the past couple of years, but its automation language, VBA, stopped evolving a long time ago. Many Excel power users have already adopted Python for daily automation tasks. This guide gets you started. Use Python without extensive programming knowledge Get started with modern tools, including Jupyter notebooks and Visual Studio code Use pandas to acquire, clean, and analyze data and replace typical Excel calculations Automate tedious tasks like consolidation of Excel workbooks and production of Excel reports Use xlwings to build interactive Excel tools that use Python as a calculation engine Connect Excel to databases and CSV files and fetch data from the internet using Python code Use Python as a single tool to replace VBA, Power Query, and Power Pivot\",\n",

This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.\",\n",

       "     'description': \"Python is fast becoming the programming language of choice for hackers, reverse engineers, and software testers because it's easy to write quickly, and it has the low-level support and libraries that make hackers happy. But until now, there has been no real manual on how to use Python for a variety of hacking tasks. You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore. Gray Hat Python explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools—and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it. You'll learn how to: –Automate tedious reversing and security tasks –Design and program your own debugger –Learn how to fuzz Windows drivers and create powerful fuzzers from scratch –Have fun with code and library injection, soft and hard hooking techniques, and other software trickery –Sniff secure traffic out of an encrypted web browser session –Use PyDBG, Immunity Debugger, Sulley, IDAPython, PyEMU, and more The world's best hackers are using Python to do their handiwork. Shouldn't you?\",\n",

       "     'description': \"A comprehensive guide to exploring modern Python through data structures, design patterns, and effective object-oriented techniques Key Features Build an intuitive understanding of object-oriented design, from introductory to mature programs Learn the ins and outs of Python syntax, libraries, and best practices Examine a machine-learning case study at the end of each chapter Book Description Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning. Steven and Dusty provide a comprehensive, illustrative tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. In addition, the book also features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem. By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs. What you will learn Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods Extend class functionality using inheritance Use exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanly Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use them Discover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in Python Uncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so important Learn to statically type check your dynamic code Understand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programs Who this book is for If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Minimal previous experience with Python is necessary.\",\n",

Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward. With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture) Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage Events, commands, and the message bus Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices',\n",

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that’s no fun for anyone. Python for Kids brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side. Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you’ll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more. As you strike out on your programming adventure, you’ll learn how to: –Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps –Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules –Use control structures like loops and conditional statements –Draw shapes and patterns with Python’s turtle module –Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter Why should serious adults have all the fun? Python for Kids is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming. For kids ages 10+ (and their parents) The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!',\n",

       "     'description': \"Portable, powerful, and a breeze to use, Python is the popular open source object-oriented programming language used for both standalone programs and scripting applications. Python is considered easy to learn, but there's no quicker way to mastery of the language than learning from an expert teacher. This edition of Learning Python puts you in the hands of two expert teachers, Mark Lutz and David Ascher, whose friendly, well-structured prose has guided many a programmer to proficiency with the language. Learning Python, Second Edition, offers programmers a comprehensive learning tool for Python and object-oriented programming. Thoroughly updated for the numerous language and class presentation changes that have taken place since the release of the first edition in 1999, this guide introduces the basic elements of the latest release of Python 2.3 and covers new features, such as list comprehensions, nested scopes, and iterators/generators. Beyond language features, this edition of Learning Python also includes new context for less-experienced programmers, including fresh overviews of object-oriented programming and dynamic typing, new discussions of program launch and configuration options, new coverage of documentation sources, and more. There are also new use cases throughout to make the application of language features more concrete. The first part of Learning Python gives programmers all the information they'll need to understand and construct programs in the Python language, including types, operators, statements, classes, functions, modules and exceptions. The authors then present more advanced material, showing how Python performs common tasks by offering real applications and the libraries available for those applications. Each chapter ends with a series of exercises that will test your Python skills and measure your understanding. Learning Python, Second Edition is a self-paced book that allows readers to focus on the core Python language in depth. As you work through the book, you'll gain a deep and complete understanding of the Python language that will help you to understand the larger application-level examples that you'll encounter on your own. If you're interested in learning Python--and want to do so quickly and efficiently--then Learning Python, Second Edition is your best choice.\",\n",

       "     'description': \"BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN NOVICE AND PROFESSIONAL You've completed a basic Python programming tutorial or finished Al Sweigart's bestseller, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. What's the next step toward becoming a capable, confident software developer? Welcome to Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python. More than a mere collection of advanced syntax and masterful tips for writing clean code, you'll learn how to advance your Python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control. Sweigart takes you through best practices for setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability, then tackles documentation, organization and performance measurement, as well as object-oriented design and the Big-O algorithm analysis commonly used in coding interviews. The skills you learn will boost your ability to program--not just in Python but in any language. You'll learn: Coding style, and how to use Python's Black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code Common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers How to structure the files in your code projects with the Cookiecutter template tool Functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions How to profile the speed of your code with Python's built-in timeit and cProfile modules The computer science behind Big-O algorithm analysis How to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them How to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they're used to organize code Toward the end of the book you'll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the Tower of Hanoi (a logic puzzle) and Four-in-a-Row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book's best practices. You'll test your skills by implementing the program yourself. Of course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. But Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer, as you learn to write readable code that's easy to debug and perfectly Pythonic Requirements: Covers Python 3.6 and higher\",\n",

The book’s primary focus is on realistic case study applications of Python. Each practical example is accompanied by a brief explanation of the problem-terminology and concepts, followed by necessary program development in Python using its constructs, and simulated testing. Given the open and participatory nature of development, Python has a variety of incorporated data structures, which has made it difficult to present it in a coherent manner. Further, some advanced concepts (super, yield, generator, decorator, etc.) are not easy to explain. The book specially addresses these challenges; starting with a minimal subset of the core, it offers users a step-by-step guide to achieving proficiency.',\n",

The language itself continues to improve with every release: writing in Python is full of possibility. But to maintain a successful Python project, you need to know more than just the language. You need tooling and instincts to help you make the most out of what's available to you. Use this book as your guide to help you hone your skills and sculpt a Python project that can stand the test of time. No matter your experience level or background, Python's batteries-included standard library and rich third-party ecosystem provide a solid foundation to build your projects on. With the right intuition and background knowledge, you can take advantage of all the power Python offers. Take a guided tour of some of Python's high points to craft a project that you can sustain and build on for a long time. Run static analysis tools to detect and eliminate classes of bugs before you run code. Experiment with Python's concurrency model and develop patterns for using Python's thread and process abstractions to their full potential. Introduce yourself to Python's type hinting system: mypy. Download and run third-party Python packages and do so safely without compromising on security. Debug code using Python's built in debugger, and try procedures out in the interactive console. Run your code under new versions of the Python interpreter to unlock performance and usability improvements. All along the way, sharpen your Python instincts so you can keep your code clean and reduce the chance of bugs. Mine Python for all you can by playing to its strengths and embracing patterns that harness its potential. What You Need: The books assumes you have some experience programming in any language (not necessarily Python). To run the code presented in the book, you'll need a Python environment which you can download from https: //www.python.org/downloads/.\",\n",

More than any other language, Python was created with the philosophy of simplicity and parsimony. Now 25 years old, Python has become the primary or secondary language (after SQL) for many business users. With popularity comes diversityâ??and possibly dilution. This guide, collaboratively written by over a hundred members of the Python community, describes best practices currently used by package and application developers. Unlike other books for this audience, The Hitchhikerâ??s Guide is light on reusable code and heavier on design philosophy, directing the reader to excellent sources that already exist.\",\n",

You will learn the basics of the language--from how to define variables and implement looping and conditional constructs, to working with existing code. Once we have established the baseline for writing code in Python, youÕll learn how to create your own functions and classes, how to extend existing code, and how to work with Python-specific things like comprehensions and generators. With a solid foundation, you will then move on to learn about the existing Python libraries, called packages, and how to use them, as well as discovering little tips and tricks that will make you a hit with all the programmers at work, and really aid you in nailing that programming interview. KEY FEATURESÊ Acquire knowledge of Python programming simply and easily. Learn about object-oriented programming and how it applies to Python. Make a splash with list comprehensions, generators, and decorators. Learn about file processing with Python, and how it makes JSON easy to deal with. Work with dictionaries and sets quickly and easily. Learn about what others have made available in the Python world. Pick up tricks and tips that will make you look like a Python expert in no time. WHAT WILL YOU LEARNÊ By the time you have finished this book, you will know enough to write complex Python programs and work with existing Python code. You will find out about the packages that make Python one of the most popular programming languages and will understand the ÒPythonicÓ way of thinking and programming. WHO THIS BOOK IS FORÊÊ This book is designed for programmers who have experience in at least one programming language. No prior Python experience is necessary, but it is assumed that you understand the basics of loops, conditionals and object-oriented constructs, such as classes. You should have or have access to a system that runs Python 3 (any version). Table of Contents 1. The history and installation of Python 2. Python types and constructs 3. The Nuts and Bolts 4.

The presentation style is compact and example-based, making it suitable for students and researchers with little or no prior experience in programming. The book uses relevant examples from mathematics and the natural sciences to present programming as a practical toolbox that can quickly enable readers to write their own programs for data processing and mathematical modeling. These tools include file reading, plotting, simple text analysis, and using NumPy for numerical computations, which are fundamental building blocks of all programs in data science and computational science. At the same time, readers are introduced to the fundamental concepts of programming, including variables, functions, loops, classes, and object-oriented programming. Accordingly, the book provides a sound basis for further computer science and programming studies.',\n",

This makes the book random-access: Items are easy to browse and study in whatever order the reader needs. I will be recommending Effective Python to students as an admirably compact source of mainstream advice on a very broad range of topics for the intermediate Python programmer.” —Brandon Rhodes, software engineer at Dropbox and chair of PyCon 2016-2017 It’s easy to start coding with Python, which is why the language is so popular. However, Python’s unique strengths, charms, and expressiveness can be hard to grasp, and there are hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up. Effective Python will help you master a truly “Pythonic” approach to programming, harnessing Python’s full power to write exceptionally robust and well-performing code. Using the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers’ best-selling Effective C++, Brett Slatkin brings together 59 Python best practices, tips, and shortcuts, and explains them with realistic code examples. Drawing on years of experience building Python infrastructure at Google, Slatkin uncovers little-known quirks and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You’ll learn the best way to accomplish key tasks, so you can write code that’s easier to understand, maintain, and improve. Key features include Actionable guidelines for all major areas of Python 3.x and 2.x development, with detailed explanations and examples Best practices for writing functions that clarify intention, promote reuse, and avoid bugs Coverage of how to accurately express behaviors with classes and objects Guidance on how to avoid pitfalls with metaclasses and dynamic attributes More efficient approaches to concurrency and parallelism Better techniques and idioms for using Python’s built-in modules Tools and best practices for collaborative development Solutions for debugging, testing, and optimization in order to improve quality and performance',\n",

Python has made great strides since Apress released the first edition of this book back in the days of Python 2.3. The advances required new chapters to be written from the ground up, and others to be extensively revised. You will learn fundamentals like IP, TCP, DNS and SSL by using working Python programs; you will also be able to familiarize yourself with infrastructure components like memcached and message queues. You can also delve into network server designs, and compare threaded approaches with asynchronous event-based solutions. But the biggest change is this edition's expanded treatment of the web. The HTTP protocol is covered in extensive detail, with each feature accompanied by sample Python code. You can use your HTTP protocol expertise by studying an entire chapter on screen scraping and you can then test lxml and BeautifulSoup against a real-world web site. The chapter on web application programming now covers both the WSGI standard for component interoperability, as well as modern web frameworks like Django. Finally, all of the old favorites from the first edition are back: E-mail protocols like SMTP, POP, and IMAP get full treatment, as does XML-RPC. You can still learn how to code Python network programs using the Telnet and FTP protocols, but you are likely to appreciate the power of more modern alternatives like the paramiko SSH2 library. If you are a Python programmer who needs to learn the network, this is the book that you want by your side.\",\n",

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike, who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book (ISLP) covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python. These labs will be useful both for Python novices, as well as experienced users.',\n",

This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, The way of the program. On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.\",\n",

All the figures and numerical results are reproducible using the Python codes provided. The author develops key intuitions in machine learning by working meaningful examples using multiple analytical methods and Python codes, thereby connecting theoretical concepts to concrete implementations. Detailed proofs for certain important results are also provided. Modern Python modules like Pandas, Sympy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras are applied to simulate and visualize important machine learning concepts like the bias/variance trade-off, cross-validation, and regularization. Many abstract mathematical ideas, such as convergence in probability theory, are developed and illustrated with numerical examples. This updated edition now includes the Fisher Exact Test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test. A new section on survival analysis has been included as well as substantial development of Generalized Linear Models. The new deep learning section for image processing includes an in-depth discussion of gradient descent methods that underpin all deep learning algorithms. As with the prior edition, there are new and updated *Programming Tips* that the illustrate effective Python modules and methods for scientific programming and machine learning. There are 445 run-able code blocks with corresponding outputs that have been tested for accuracy. Over 158 graphical visualizations (almost all generated using Python) illustrate the concepts that are developed both in code and in mathematics. We also discuss and use key Python modules such as Numpy, Scikit-learn, Sympy, Scipy, Lifelines, CvxPy, Theano, Matplotlib, Pandas, Tensorflow, Statsmodels, and Keras. This book is suitable for anyone with an undergraduate-level exposure to probability, statistics, or machine learning and with rudimentary knowledge of Python programming.',\n",

The book presents a hands-on approach to using Python for real marketing questions, organized by key topic areas. Following the Python scientific computing movement toward reproducible research, the book presents all analyses in Colab notebooks, which integrate code, figures, tables, and annotation in a single file. The code notebooks for each chapter may be copied, adapted, and reused in one's own analyses. The book also introduces the usage of machine learning predictive models using the Python sklearn package in the context of marketing research. This book is designed for three groups of readers: experienced marketing researchers who wish to learn to program in Python, coming from tools and languages such as R, SAS, or SPSS; analysts or students who already program in Python and wish to learn about marketing applications; and undergraduate or graduate marketing students with little or no programming background. It presumes only an introductory level of familiarity with formal statistics and contains a minimum of mathematics.\",\n",

If you\\'re looking to break into a coding or data-science career, you\\'ll pick up the practical foundations with this book. We won\\'t just dump a boat load of theoretical information on you so you can \"sink or swim\"-instead you\\'ll learn from hands-on, practical examples one step at a time. Each concept is broken down for you so you\\'ll always know what you can do with it in practical terms. If you\\'re interested in teaching others \"how to Python,\" this will be your guidebook. If you\\'re looking to stoke the coding flame in your coworkers, kids, or relatives-use our material to teach them. All the sequencing has been done for you so you\\'ll always know what to cover next and how to explain it. What Python Developers Say About The Book: \"Go forth and learn this amazing language using this great book.\" - Michael Kennedy, Talk Python \"The wording is casual, easy to understand, and makes the information flow well.\" - Thomas Wong, Pythonista \"I floundered for a long time trying to teach myself. I slogged through dozens of incomplete online tutorials. I snoozed through hours of boring screencasts. I gave up on countless crufty books from big-time publishers. And then I found Real Python. The easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions break the big concepts down into bite-sized chunks written in plain English. The authors never forget their audience and are consistently thorough and detailed in their explanations. I\\'m up and running now, but I constantly refer to the material for guidance.\" - Jared Nielsen, Pythonista',\n",

This book is ideal for readers with some Python programming experience. The book covers key language concepts that must be understood to program effectively, especially for data analysis applications. Certain low-level language features are discussed in detail, especially Python memory management and data structures. Using Python effectively means taking advantage of its vast ecosystem. The book discusses Python package management and how to use third-party modules as well as how to structure your own Python modules. The section on object-oriented programming explains features of the language that facilitate common programming patterns. After developing the key Python language features, the book moves on to third-party modules that are foundational for effective data analysis, starting with Numpy. The book develops key Numpy concepts and discusses internal Numpy array data structures and memory usage. Then, the author moves onto Pandas and details its many features for data processing and alignment. Because strong visualizations are important for communicating data analysis, key modules such as Matplotlib are developed in detail, along with web-based options such as Bokeh, Holoviews, Altair, and Plotly. The text is sprinkled with many tricks-of-the-trade that help avoid common pitfalls. The author explains the internal logic embodied in the Python language so that readers can get into the Python mindset and make better design choices in their codes, which is especially helpful for newcomers to both Python and data analysis. To get the most out of this book, open a Python interpreter and type along with the many code samples.',\n",

Mark Summerfield focuses on four key themes: design patterns for coding elegance, faster processing through concurrency and compiled Python (Cython), high-level networking, and graphics. He identifies well-proven design patterns that are useful in Python, illuminates them with expert-quality code, and explains why some object-oriented design patterns are irrelevant to Python. He also explodes several counterproductive myths about Python programming—showing, for example, how Python can take full advantage of multicore hardware. All examples, including three complete case studies, have been tested with Python 3.3 (and, where possible, Python 3.2 and 3.1) and crafted to maintain compatibility with future Python 3.x versions. All code has been tested on Linux, and most code has also been tested on OS X and Windows. All code may be downloaded at www.qtrac.eu/pipbook.html. Coverage includes Leveraging Python’s most effective creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns Supporting concurrency with Python’s multiprocessing, threading, and concurrent.futures modules Avoiding concurrency problems using thread-safe queues and futures rather than fragile locks Simplifying networking with high-level modules, including xmlrpclib and RPyC Accelerating Python code with Cython, C-based Python modules, profiling, and other techniques Creating modern-looking GUI applications with Tkinter Leveraging today’s powerful graphics hardware via the OpenGL API using pyglet and PyOpenGL',\n",

You don't use monitors or keyboards with them, but program them over USB to take their input from (and send their output to) their input/output (IO) pins. Using these programmable connections, you can light lights, make noises, send text to screens, and much more. In Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico, you will learn how to use the beginner-friendly language MicroPython to write programs and connect up hardware to make your Raspberry Pi Pico interact with the world around it. Using these skills, you can create your own electro-mechanical projects, whether for fun or to make your life easier. This book shows you how to: Get started with Raspberry Pi Pico Work with various electronic components Create your own programmable electronic contraptions Work with Programming Input and Output (PIO) for low level, timing-critical projects Learn the Raspberry Pi Pico pinouts for hooking up components Use the I2C and SPI protocols to connect to components By the end of the book, you'll know how to create your own programmable electronic contraptions. What you do with them is up to you.\",\n",

This second edition of the well-received book has been extensively revised: All code is now written in Python version 3.6 (no longer version 2.7). In addition, the two first chapters of the previous edition have been extended and split up into five new chapters, thus expanding the introduction to programming from 50 to 150 pages. Throughout the book, the explanations provided are now more detailed, previous examples have been modified, and new sections, examples and exercises have been added. Also, a number of small errors have been corrected. The book was inspired by the Springer book TCSE 6: A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python (by Langtangen), but the style employed is more accessible and concise, in keeping with the needs of engineering students. The book outlines the shortest possible path from no previous experience with programming to a set of skills that allows students to write simple programs for solving common mathematical problems with numerical methods in the context of engineering and science courses. The emphasis is on generic algorithms, clean program design, the use of functions, and automatic tests for verification.',\n",

Key FeaturesPractical coverage of every image processing task with popular Python librariesIncludes topics such as pseudo-coloring, noise smoothing, computing image descriptorsCovers popular machine learning and deep learning techniques for complex image processing tasksBook Description Image processing plays an important role in our daily lives with various applications such as in social media (face detection), medical imaging (X-ray, CT-scan), security (fingerprint recognition) to robotics & space. This book will touch the core of image processing, from concepts to code using Python. The book will start from the classical image processing techniques and explore the evolution of image processing algorithms up to the recent advances in image processing or computer vision with deep learning. We will learn how to use image processing libraries such as PIL, scikit-mage, and scipy ndimage in Python. This book will enable us to write code snippets in Python 3 and quickly implement complex image processing algorithms such as image enhancement, filtering, segmentation, object detection, and classification. We will be able to use machine learning models using the scikit-learn library and later explore deep CNN, such as VGG-19 with Keras, and we will also use an end-to-end deep learning model called YOLO for object detection. We will also cover a few advanced problems, such as image inpainting, gradient blending, variational denoising, seam carving, quilting, and morphing. By the end of this book, we will have learned to implement various algorithms for efficient image processing.

       "     'description': \"LEARN HOW TO USE DATA STRUCTURES IN WRITING HIGH PERFORMANCE PYTHON PROGRAMS AND ALGORITHMS This practical introduction to data structures and algorithms can help every programmer who wants to write more efficient software. Building on Robert Lafore's legendary Java-based guide, this book helps you understand exactly how data structures and algorithms operate. You'll learn how to efficiently apply them with the enormously popular Python language and scale your code to handle today's big data challenges. Throughout, the authors focus on real-world examples, communicate key ideas with intuitive, interactive visualizations, and limit complexity and math to what you need to improve performance. Step-by-step, they introduce arrays, sorting, stacks, queues, linked lists, recursion, binary trees, 2-3-4 trees, hash tables, spatial data structures, graphs, and more. Their code examples and illustrations are so clear, you can understand them even if you're a near-beginner, or your experience is with other procedural or object-oriented languages. Build core computer science skills that take you beyond merely “writing code” Learn how data structures make programs (and programmers) more efficient See how data organization and algorithms affect how much you can do with today's, and tomorrow's, computing resources Develop data structure implementation skills you can use in any language Choose the best data structure(s) and algorithms for each programming problem—and recognize which ones to avoid Data Structures & Algorithms in Python is packed with examples, review questions, individual and team exercises, thought experiments, and longer programming projects. It's ideal for both self-study and classroom settings, and either as a primary text or as a complement to a more formal presentation.\",\n",

Key FeaturesDesign, train, and evaluate machine learning algorithms that underpin automated trading strategiesCreate a research and strategy development process to apply predictive modeling to trading decisionsLeverage NLP and deep learning to extract tradeable signals from market and alternative dataBook Description The explosive growth of digital data has boosted the demand for expertise in trading strategies that use machine learning (ML). This revised and expanded second edition enables you to build and evaluate sophisticated supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models. This book introduces end-to-end machine learning for the trading workflow, from the idea and feature engineering to model optimization, strategy design, and backtesting. It illustrates this by using examples ranging from linear models and tree-based ensembles to deep-learning techniques from cutting edge research. This edition shows how to work with market, fundamental, and alternative data, such as tick data, minute and daily bars, SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, financial news, or satellite images to generate tradeable signals. It illustrates how to engineer financial features or alpha factors that enable an ML model to predict returns from price data for US and international stocks and ETFs. It also shows how to assess the signal content of new features using Alphalens and SHAP values and includes a new appendix with over one hundred alpha factor examples. By the end, you will be proficient in translating ML model predictions into a trading strategy that operates at daily or intraday horizons, and in evaluating its performance.

       "     'description': 'The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, [1] and its implementation was started in December 1989[2] by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC (programming language) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[3] Van Rossum is Python\\'s principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).[4][5] Python was named for the BBC TV show Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus.[6] Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.[7] Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008[8] after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.[9] In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.[10] Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of list, dict, str and so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as \"one of Python\\'s major programming units.\"[1] Python\\'s exception model also resembles Modula-3\\'s, with the addition of an else clause.[3] In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python\\'s userbase.[1] Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce. Van Rossum stated that \"Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches.\"[11] The last version released while Van Rossum was at CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Van Rossum continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia whence he released several versions. By version 1.4, Python had acquired several new features. Notable among these are the Modula-3 inspired keyword arguments (which are also similar to Common Lisp\\'s keyword arguments) and built-in support for complex numbers. Also included is a basic form of data hiding by name mangling, though this is easily bypassed.[12] During Van Rossum\\'s stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic \"literacy\" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E\\'s goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA.[13] As of 2007, the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, reaching out to non-programmers is not an active concern.[14] Here are what people are saying about the book: This is the best beginner\\'s tutorial I\\'ve ever seen! Thank you for your effort. -- Walt Michalik The best thing i found was \"A Byte of Python,\" which is simply a brilliant book for a beginner. It\\'s well written, the concepts are well explained with self evident examples. -- Joshua Robin Excellent gentle introduction to programming #Python for beginners -- Shan Rajasekaran Best newbie guide to python -- Nickson Kaigi start to love python with every single page read -- Herbert Feutl perfect beginners guide for python, will give u key to unlock magical world of python',\n",

After a crash course in Python programming basics, you’ll learn to make, test, and hack programs that encrypt text with classical ciphers like the transposition cipher and Vigenère cipher. You’ll begin with simple programs for the reverse and Caesar ciphers and then work your way up to public key cryptography, the type of encryption used to secure today’s online transactions, including digital signatures, email, and Bitcoin. Each program includes the full code and a line-by-line explanation of how things work. By the end of the book, you’ll have learned how to code in Python and you’ll have the clever programs to prove it! You’ll also learn how to: - Combine loops, variables, and flow control statements into real working programs - Use dictionary files to instantly detect whether decrypted messages are valid English or gibberish - Create test programs to make sure that your code encrypts and decrypts correctly - Code (and hack!) a working example of the affine cipher, which uses modular arithmetic to encrypt a message - Break ciphers with techniques such as brute-force and frequency analysis There’s no better way to learn to code than to play with real programs. Cracking Codes with Python makes the learning fun!',\n",

This book offers a detailed and up-to-date introduction to machine learning (including deep learning) through the unifying lens of probabilistic modeling and Bayesian decision theory. The book covers mathematical background (including linear algebra and optimization), basic supervised learning (including linear and logistic regression and deep neural networks), as well as more advanced topics (including transfer learning and unsupervised learning). End-of-chapter exercises allow students to apply what they have learned, and an appendix covers notation. Probabilistic Machine Learning grew out of the author’s 2012 book, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective. More than just a simple update, this is a completely new book that reflects the dramatic developments in the field since 2012, most notably deep learning. In addition, the new book is accompanied by online Python code, using libraries such as scikit-learn, JAX, PyTorch, and Tensorflow, which can be used to reproduce nearly all the figures; this code can be run inside a web browser using cloud-based notebooks, and provides a practical complement to the theoretical topics discussed in the book. This introductory text will be followed by a sequel that covers more advanced topics, taking the same probabilistic approach.',\n",

This book is designed in such a way that you start from basics, followed by advance levels and then move on to some industry-related modules. The initial chapters are written in a simple manner; some chapters are of advance level. Start from the data structure of Python, such as string, list, tuple, and dictionary. The function and module chapter will let you know how to organize a large code. The built-in functions and modules like collections will give you greater flexibility to write efficient codes. The \"e;time\"e; chapter is very important when we deal with time-related things. The mid-chapter contains the advance chapters such as regular expressions, interaction with OS, and multithreading. These chapters are helpful when we want to search the pattern, run the OS commands, and execute the program in parallel. The last chapters are specially designed from an industry point of view. In order to ensure a high quality of code, we use config-parser to avoid hard-coding and logger to log the events. In the multiprocessing and subprocess chapter, you will learn creation, execution, and communication between the processes. What will you learnPython for developers is created by taking beginner and intermediate programmers. The book starts from scratch and takes you to the advanced level. After learning advance levels, you will learn parallel programming using multithreading, multiprocessing, and sub-processing. The book will provide information on modules which will be helpful form industry perspective. The book also contains the question for the preparation of the interview. You will also learn the difference between Python 2.7 and Python 3.7. Some of the chapters include an advance part, which will give an in-depth knowledge of the chapters. Who this book is forThis book is for whoever wants to learn Python and aspires to become a developer or work on projects. Beginners can read this book easily; however, a little knowledge about the programming concepts would be helpful. Basic knowledge of computers would suffice.Table of Contents1.

       "     'description': 'Manage and Automate Data Analysis with Pandas in Python Today, analysts must manage data characterized by extraordinary variety, velocity, and volume. Using the open source Pandas library, you can use Python to rapidly automate and perform virtually any data analysis task, no matter how large or complex. Pandas can help you ensure the veracity of your data, visualize it for effective decision-making, and reliably reproduce analyses across multiple data sets. Pandas for Everyone, 2nd Edition, brings together practical knowledge and insight for solving real problems with Pandas, even if you’re new to Python data analysis. Daniel Y. Chen introduces key concepts through simple but practical examples, incrementally building on them to solve more difficult, real-world data science problems such as using regularization to prevent data overfitting, or when to use unsupervised machine learning methods to find the underlying structure in a data set. New features to the second edition include: Extended coverage of plotting and the seaborn data visualization library Expanded examples and resources Updated Python 3.9 code and packages coverage, including statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries Online bonus material on geopandas, Dask, and creating interactive graphics with Altair Chen gives you a jumpstart on using Pandas with a realistic data set and covers combining data sets, handling missing data, and structuring data sets for easier analysis and visualization. He demonstrates powerful data cleaning techniques, from basic string manipulation to applying functions simultaneously across dataframes. Once your data is ready, Chen guides you through fitting models for prediction, clustering, inference, and exploration. He provides tips on performance and scalability and introduces you to the wider Python data analysis ecosystem. Work with DataFrames and Series, and import or export data Create plots with matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas Combine data sets and handle missing data Reshape, tidy, and clean data sets so they’re easier to work with Convert data types and manipulate text strings Apply functions to scale data manipulations Aggregate, transform, and filter large data sets with groupby Leverage Pandas’ advanced date and time capabilities Fit linear models using statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries Use generalized linear modeling to fit models with different response variables Compare multiple models to select the “best” one Regularize to overcome overfitting and improve performance Use clustering in unsupervised machine learning',\n",

Now, leading Python programmer Mark Summerfield demonstrates how to write code that takes full advantage of Python 3’s features and idioms. The first book written from a completely “Python 3” viewpoint, Programming in Python 3 brings together all the knowledge you need to write any program, use any standard or third-party Python 3 library, and create new library modules of your own. Summerfield draws on his many years of Python experience to share deep insights into Python 3 development you won’t find anywhere else. He begins by illuminating Python’s “beautiful heart”: the eight key elements of Python you need to write robust, high-performance programs. Building on these core elements, he introduces new topics designed to strengthen your practical expertise—one concept and hands-on example at a time. This book’s coverage includes Developing in Python using procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms Creating custom packages and modules Writing and reading binary, text, and XML files, including optional compression, random access, and text and XML parsing Leveraging advanced data types, collections, control structures, and functions Spreading program workloads across multiple processes and threads Programming SQL databases and key-value DBM files Utilizing Python’s regular expression mini-language and module Building usable, efficient, GUI-based applications Advanced programming techniques, including generators, function and class decorators, context managers, descriptors, abstract base classes, metaclasses, and more Programming in Python 3 serves as both tutorial and language reference, and it is accompanied by extensive downloadable example code—all of it tested with the final version of Python 3 on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.',\n",

Python was created in 1990 by Guido van Rossu, and is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It has become extremely popular over the past decade, thanks to its intuitive nature, flexibility, and versatility. Python can be used on a wide variety of operating systems, and its clean, readable code style makes it relatively beginner-friendly, while not as fast as other languages, such as C++ or JAVA, Python code is often much shorter and simpler than other languages. Python also supports several packages and modules created by other developers to make the development of Python applications quicker and easier. There are hundreds of different programming languages out there in the world, with Wikipedia listing over 700 notable languages. Given how many languages you could potentially learn, why learn Python? Python has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years, driven by several aspects that make it an incredibly versatile and intuitive language. A huge selling point of Python is the cleanliness and readability of its syntax and structure. Commands in Python can often be carried out using simple English keywords, which makes the language much more intuitive than many other languages. Python is also quite versatile in the sense that it supports both structured programming and object-oriented programming approaches. Python even allows the use of certain aspects of functional programming. This Book Covers: Understanding Python Why the name \"Python\"? Python Glossary Python Installation Python Data Types And much more!! Despite its simplicity, Python is also sturdy and robust enough to carry out complex scientific and mathematical tasks. Python has been designed with features that drastically simplify the visualization and analysis of data. Ready to get started? Click the BUY NOW button!',\n",

It not only enables students to learn programming with the aid of examples from these fields but also provides ample motivation for engagement in independent research. The book opens by outlining the importance of computational methods and programming algorithms in contemporary astronomical and astrophysical research, showing why programming in Python is a good choice for beginners. The performance of basic calculations with Python is then explained with reference to, for example, Kepler’s laws of planetary motion and gravitational and tidal forces. Here, essential background knowledge is provided as necessary. Subsequent chapters are designed to teach the reader to define and use important functions in Python and to utilize numerical methods to solve differential equations and landmark dynamical problems in astrophysics. Finally, the analysis of astronomical data is discussed, with various hands-on examples as well as guidance on astronomical image analysis and applications of artificial neural networks.',\n",

Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor. This book is your ticket to becoming a parsing guru! What You Need: ANTLR 4.0 and above. Java development tools. Ant build system optional(needed for building ANTLR from source)\",\n",

Key FeaturesDelve into supervised learning and grasp how a machine learns from dataImplement popular machine learning algorithms from scratch, developing a deep understanding along the wayExplore some of the most popular scientific and mathematical libraries in the Python languageBook Description Supervised machine learning is used in a wide range of sectors (such as finance, online advertising, and analytics) because it allows you to train your system to make pricing predictions, campaign adjustments, customer recommendations, and much more while the system self-adjusts and makes decisions on its own. As a result, it's crucial to know how a machine “learns” under the hood. This book will guide you through the implementation and nuances of many popular supervised machine learning algorithms while facilitating a deep understanding along the way. You’ll embark on this journey with a quick overview and see how supervised machine learning differs from unsupervised learning. Next, we explore parametric models such as linear and logistic regression, non-parametric methods such as decision trees, and various clustering techniques to facilitate decision-making and predictions. As we proceed, you'll work hands-on with recommender systems, which are widely used by online companies to increase user interaction and enrich shopping potential. Finally, you’ll wrap up with a brief foray into neural networks and transfer learning. By the end of this book, you’ll be equipped with hands-on techniques and will have gained the practical know-how you need to quickly and powerfully apply algorithms to new problems. What you will learnCrack how a machine learns a concept and generalize its understanding to new dataUncover the fundamental differences between parametric and non-parametric modelsImplement and grok several well-known supervised learning algorithms from scratchWork with models in domains such as ecommerce and marketingExpand your expertise and use various algorithms such as regression, decision trees, and clusteringBuild your own models capable of making predictionsDelve into the most popular approaches in deep learning such as transfer learning and neural networksWho this book is for This book is for aspiring machine learning developers who want to get started with supervised learning.

       "     'description': 'Maintaining a practical perspective, Python Programming: A Practical Approach acquaints you with the wonderful world of programming. The book is a starting point for those who want to learn Python programming. The backbone of any programming, which is the data structure and components such as strings, lists, etc., have been illustrated with many examples and enough practice problems to instill a level of self-confidence in the reader. Drawing on knowledge gained directly from teaching Computer Science as a subject and working on a wide range of projects related to ML, AI, deep learning, and blockchain, the authors have tried their best to present the necessary skills for a Python programmer. Once the foundation of Python programming is built and the readers are aware of the exact structure, dimensions, processing, building blocks, and representation of data, they can readily take up their specific problems from the area of interest and solve them with the help of Python. These include, but are not limited to, operators, control flow, strings, functions, module processing, object-oriented programming, exception and file handling, multithreading, synchronization, regular expressions, and Python database programming. This book on Python programming is specially designed to keep readers busy with learning fundamentals and generates a sense of confidence by attempting the assignment problems. We firmly believe that explaining any particular technology deviates from learning the fundamentals of a programming language. This book is focused on helping readers attempt implementation in their areas of interest through the skills imparted through this book. We have attempted to present the real essence of Python programming, which you can confidently apply in real life by using Python as a tool. Salient Features Based on real-world requirements and solution. Simple presentation without avoiding necessary details of the topic. Executable programs on almost every topic. Plenty of exercise questions, designed to test readers’ skills and understanding. Purposefully designed to be instantly applicable, Python Programming: A Practical Approach provides implementation examples so that the described subject matter can be immediately implemented due to the well-known versatility of Python in handling different data types with ease.',\n",

What You Will Learn Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods Separate related objects into a taxonomy of classes and describe the properties and behaviors of those objects via the class interface Extend class functionality using inheritance Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3 Exploit object-oriented programming in key Python technologies such as Kivy and Django. Object-oriented programming concurrently with asyncio In Detail Python 3 is more versatile and easier to use than ever. It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax. Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception. Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software. You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program. You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy. This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It's also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published. Style and approach Throughout the book you will learn key object-oriented programming techniques demonstrated by comprehensive case studies in the context of a larger project.\",\n",

After this, you will know how to choose a dataset for natural language processing applications and find the right NLP techniques to process sentences in datasets and understand their structure. You will also learn how to tokenize different parts of sentences and ways to analyze them. During the course of the book, you will explore the semantic as well as syntactic analysis of text. You will understand how to solve various ambiguities in processing human language and will come across various scenarios while performing text analysis. You will learn the very basics of getting the environment ready for natural language processing, move on to the initial setup, and then quickly understand sentences and language parts. You will learn the power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to extract information from text data. By the end of the book, you will have a clear understanding of natural language processing and will have worked on multiple examples that implement NLP in the real world. Style and approach This book teaches the readers various aspects of natural language Processing using NLTK. It takes the reader from the basic to advance level in a smooth way.',\n",

       "     'description': \"In 2005, Microsoft quietly announced an initiative to bring dynamic languages to the .NET platform. The starting point for this project was a .NET implementation of Python, dubbed IronPython. After a couple years of incubation, IronPython is ready for real-world use. It blends the simplicity, elegance, and dynamism of Python with the power of the .NET framework. IronPython in Action offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to Microsoft's exciting new approach for programming the .NET framework. It approaches IronPython as a first class .NET language, fully integrated with the .NET environment, Visual Studio, and even the open-source Mono implementation. You'll learn how IronPython can be embedded as a ready-made scripting language into C# and VB.NET programs, used for writing full applications or for web development with ASP. Even better, you'll see how IronPython works in Silverlight for client-side web programming. IronPython opens up exciting new possibilities. Because it's a dynamic language, it permits programming paradigms not easily available in VB and C#. In this book, authors Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead explore the world of functional programming, live introspection, dynamic typing and duck typing , metaprogramming, and more. IronPython in Action explores these topics with examples, making use of the Python interactive console to explore the .NET framework with live objects. The expert authors provide a complete introduction for programmers to both the Python language and the power of the .NET framework. The book also shows how to extend IronPython with C#, extending C# and VB.NET applications with Python, using IronPython with .NET 3.0 and Powershell, IronPython as a Windows scripting tool, and much more. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.\",\n",

If you are a Python programmer who wants to code efficiently by getting the syntax and usage of a few intricate Python techniques exactly right, this book is for you. What You Will Learn Create a virtualenv and start a new project Understand how and when to use the functional programming paradigm Get familiar with the different ways the decorators can be written in Understand the power of generators and coroutines without digressing into lambda calculus Create metaclasses and how it makes working with Python far easier Generate HTML documentation out of documents and code using Sphinx Learn how to track and optimize application performance, both memory and cpu Use the multiprocessing library, not just locally but also across multiple machines Get a basic understanding of packaging and creating your own libraries/applications In Detail Python is a dynamic programming language. It is known for its high readability and hence it is often the first language learned by new programmers. Python being multi-paradigm, it can be used to achieve the same thing in different ways and it is compatible across different platforms. Even if you find writing Python code easy, writing code that is efficient, easy to maintain, and reuse is not so straightforward. This book is an authoritative guide that will help you learn new advanced methods in a clear and contextualised way. It starts off by creating a project-specific environment using venv, introducing you to different Pythonic syntax and common pitfalls before moving on to cover the functional features in Python. It covers how to create different decorators, generators, and metaclasses. It also introduces you to functools.wraps and coroutines and how they work. Later on you will learn to use asyncio module for asynchronous clients and servers. You will also get familiar with different testing systems such as py.test, doctest, and unittest, and debugging tools such as Python debugger and faulthandler. You will learn to optimize application performance so that it works efficiently across multiple machines and Python versions. Finally, it will teach you how to access C functions with a simple Python call. By the end of the book, you will be able to write more advanced scripts and take on bigger challenges. Style and Approach This book is a comprehensive guide that covers advanced features of the Python language, and communicate them with an authoritative understanding of the underlying rationale for how, when, and why to use them.\",\n",

The creator of this programming language was Guido Van Rossum, released first in the year 1991. The multiple supporting programming paradigms made itself unique from other programming languages as it had some outstanding features like unique adaptability, the ability to adopt machine learning, scientific computation, cloud infrastructure and above all web development. Python's role is really commendable in both software development, as well as, web development. This book is helpful for learning everything Python has to offer.By connecting with a database system Python can read and modify files. To create workflows in Software, this language is helpful. Python also supports a dynamic type system, automatic memory management, object-oriented and structured programming. Moreover, this programming language has the potential to support the various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. Where the other programming languages use semicolon or parentheses to complete a command, Python uses new lines to complete it. Python Coding and Programming Python is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on the code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook.It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc, and those languages hire Python designs for their development. Linux for beginners For computers, servers, mainframes, mobile, and embedded devices, Linux is an open-source and community-developed and operating system. As it is an open source OS, the code is free to create Linux. That's why the appropriate skills for the users are necessary, even if they are beginners, so that they can get the best out of the operating system. This is not only used by the web programmers but also by the regular computer or laptop users and even mobile phones. Get hold of the eBook to learn more. As it is a bit different from the popular operating system like Windows or Android, it takes a little bit of time to get the hang of it. The most important thing about Linux that it is free. It is really hard to hack into Linux as it is highly secured. For different types of users, there are different flavors and the available flavors are called 'distributions'.

       "     'description': 'Optics is an enabling science that forms a basis for our technological civilization. Courses in optics are a required part of the engineering or physics undergraduate curriculum in many universities worldwide. The aim of Understanding Optics with Python is twofold: first, to describe certain basic ideas of classical physical and geometric optics; second, to introduce the reader to computer simulations of physical phenomena. The text is aimed more broadly for those who wish to use numerical/computational modeling as an educational tool that promotes interactive teaching (and learning). In addition, it offers an alternative to developing countries where the necessary equipment to carry out the appropriate experiments is not available as a result of financial constraints. This approach contributes to a better diffusion of knowledge about optics. The examples given in this book are comparable to those found in standard textbooks on optics and are suitable for self-study. This text enables the user to study and understand optics using hands-on simulations with Python. Python is our programming language of choice because of its open-source availability, extensive functionality, and an enormous online support. Essentials of programming in Python 3.x, including graphical user interface, are also provided. The codes in the book are available for download on the book’s website. Discusses most standard topics of traditional physical and geometrical optics through Python and PyQt5 Provides visualizations and in-depth descriptions of Python’s programming language and simulations Includes simulated laboratories where students are provided a \"hands-on\" exploration of Python software Coding and programming featured within the text are available for download on the book’s corresponding website. \"Understanding Optics with Python by Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan, Hassen Ghalila, Ahmed Ammar, and L. Srinivasa Varadharajan is born around a nice idea: using simulations to provide the students with a powerful tool to understand and master optical phenomena. The choice of the Python language is perfectly matched with the overall goal of the book, as the Python language provides a completely free and easy-to-learn platform with huge cross-platform compatibility, where the reader of the book can conduct his or her own numerical experiments to learn faster and better.\" — Costantino De Angelis, University of Brescia, Italy \"Teaching an important programming language like Python through concrete examples from optics is a natural and, in my view, very effective approach. I believe that this book will be used by students and appreciated greatly by instructors. The topic of modelling optical effects and systems where the students should already have a physical background provides great motivation for students to learn the basics of a powerful programming language without the intimidation factor that often goes with a formal computer science course.\" — John Dudley, FEMTO-ST Institute, Besançon, France',\n",

       "     'description': 'The classic guide to how computers work, updated with new chapters and interactive graphics \"For me, Code was a revelation. It was the first book about programming that spoke to me. It started with a story, and it built up, layer by layer, analogy by analogy, until I understood not just the Code, but the System. Code is a book that is as much about Systems Thinking and abstractions as it is about code and programming. Code teaches us how many unseen layers there are between the computer systems that we as users look at every day and the magical silicon rocks that we infused with lightning and taught to think.\" - Scott Hanselman, Partner Program Director, Microsoft, and host of Hanselminutes Computers are everywhere, most obviously in our laptops and smartphones, but also our cars, televisions, microwave ovens, alarm clocks, robot vacuum cleaners, and other smart appliances. Have you ever wondered what goes on inside these devices to make our lives easier but occasionally more infuriating? For more than 20 years, readers have delighted in Charles Petzold\\'s illuminating story of the secret inner life of computers, and now he has revised it for this new age of computing. Cleverly illustrated and easy to understand, this is the book that cracks the mystery. You\\'ll discover what flashlights, black cats, seesaws, and the ride of Paul Revere can teach you about computing, and how human ingenuity and our compulsion to communicate have shaped every electronic device we use. This new expanded edition explores more deeply the bit-by-bit and gate-by-gate construction of the heart of every smart device, the central processing unit that combines the simplest of basic operations to perform the most complex of feats. Petzold\\'s companion website, CodeHiddenLanguage.com, uses animated graphics of key circuits in the book to make computers even easier to comprehend. In addition to substantially revised and updated content, new chapters include: Chapter 18: Let\\'s Build a Clock! Chapter 21: The Arithmetic Logic Unit Chapter 22: Registers and Busses Chapter 23: CPU Control Signals Chapter 24: Jumps, Loops, and Calls Chapter 28: The World Brain From the simple ticking of clocks to the worldwide hum of the internet, Code reveals the essence of the digital revolution.',\n",

The creator of this programming language was Guido Van Rossum, released first in the year 1991. The multiple supporting programming paradigms made itself unique from other programming languages as it had some outstanding features like unique adaptability, the ability to adopt machine learning, scientific computation, cloud infrastructure and above all web development. Python's role is really commendable in both software development, as well as, web development. This book is helpful for learning everything Python has to offer.By connecting with a database system Python can read and modify files. To create workflows in Software, this language is helpful. Python also supports a dynamic type system, automatic memory management, object-oriented and structured programming. Moreover, this programming language has the potential to support the various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. Where the other programming languages use semicolon or parentheses to complete a command, Python uses new lines to complete it. Python Coding and Programming Python is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on the code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook. It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc, and those languages hire Python designs for their development.

By showing how to combine the high-level elegance, accessibility, and flexibility of Python, with the low-level computational efficiency of C++, in the context of interesting financial modeling problems, they have provided an implementation template which will be useful to others seeking to jointly optimize the use of computational and human resources. They document all the necessary technical details required in order to make external numerical libraries available from within Python, and they contribute a useful library of their own, which will significantly reduce the start-up costs involved in building financial models. This book is a must read for all those with a need to apply numerical methods in the valuation of financial claims.\" –David Louton, Professor of Finance, Bryant University This book is directed at both industry practitioners and students interested in designing a pricing and risk management framework for financial derivatives using the Python programming language. It is a practical book complete with working, tested code that guides the reader through the process of building a flexible, extensible pricing framework in Python. The pricing frameworks\\' loosely coupled fundamental components have been designed to facilitate the quick development of new models. Concrete applications to real-world pricing problems are also provided. Topics are introduced gradually, each building on the last. They include basic mathematical algorithms, common algorithms from numerical analysis, trade, market and event data model representations, lattice and simulation based pricing, and model development. The mathematics presented is kept simple and to the point. The book also provides a host of information on practical technical topics such as C++/Python hybrid development (embedding and extending) and techniques for integrating Python based programs with Microsoft Excel.',\n",

Well, this book is your best choice! There may be a lot of different languages that you can work with when it comes to the coding that you would like to work with, but none are going to provide you with the benefits that you are working with. This language is so popular and used so often that there are a few different operating systems that already have some version of Python found on them for you to use. This can make it easier to get some of the coding done that you would like, and will ensure that you will get the best benefits out of it in no time. ★★★This book covers:★★★ ★ What Is Python and His History and Why Learn Python ★ Getting Started with Python ★ Variables and Operators ★ Basic Operators ★ Data Types in Python And so much more!! The Python language is more natural to read: If you take a look through some of the codes that we have later on in this guidebook, you will find that this is an easy task to read through some of the different parts of the law. Even if you have not been able to work with this language before, you will still be able to look at some of the systems and notice that you recognize the parts as well. The program is open source. This means that you won\\'t have to worry about someone taking over the code and ruining it. It also means that the original Python is free and available to anyone who wants to download it.

       "     'description': 'In 1969, the BBC aired the first episode of a new comedy series titled Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus, and the rest, as they say, is history. An instant success, the show ran until 1974, producing a total of 45 episodes. Despite the show\\'s very English humor and allusions to many things British, the series developed a cult following outside the U.K., particularly in the United States. Known for its outrageous humor, occasionally controversial content, and often silly spirit, Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus poked fun at nearly all institutions--domestic or foreign, grand or intimate, sacred or not. Indeed, many of the allusions and references in the program were uniquely British and routinely obscure, and therefore, not always understood or even noticed outside the British Isles. This exhaustive reference identifies and explains the plethora of cultural, historical, and topical allusions of this landmark series. In this resource, virtually every allusion and reference that appeared in an episode--whether stated by a character, depicted in the mise-en-scene, or mentioned in the printed scripts--is identified and explained. Organized chronologically by episode, each entry is listed alphabetically, indicates what sketch it appeared in, and is cross-referenced between episodes. Entries cover literary and metaphoric allusions, symbolisms, names, peoples, and places; as well as the myriad social, cultural, and historical elements (photos, songs, slogans, caricatures) that populate and inform these episodes. Entries Include: -\"Arabella Plunkett\" -Group of famous characters from famous paintings -Hell\\'s Grannies -HRH The Dummy Princess Margaret -\"Kandinsky\" -\"On the Dad\\'s Liver Bachelors at Large\" -Raymond Baxter type -Scun -\"Spanish Inquisition\" -\"Third Parachute Brigade Amateur Dramatic Society\" -\"total cashectomy\" -\"Two-Sheds\" -\"Umbonga\\'s hostile opening\" -Vicar sitting thin and unhappy in a pot -\"What\\'s all this then?\"',\n",

       "     'description': '\"One of the finest and most accurate records of the making of the film that I have ever read. I just wished I could remember what actually went on then.\" --Terry Jones \"If anyone can remember more about making the Life of Brian than me, it\\'s Kim ‘Howard\\' Johnson. He came, he saw, he got into costume. While the rest of us were fighting to upstage each other, Howard had a notebook hidden in his toga.\" --Michael Palin \"Since I\\'ve forgotten everything, it will be great to read what was actually going on in Tunisia. Just as long as I\\'m the most quoted, the most vital to the shooting, and the most interesting. You don\\'t have to mention my stunning good looks if you don\\'t want to.\" --Terry Gilliam \"Of all the books that I am planning to read in my dotage, there is none I am more looking forward to than Monty Python\\'s Tunisian Holiday. . . . Not only does ‘Howard\\' Johnson know more about Python than anyone outside of the IRS, he was in Tunisia for most of the filming of Life of Brian, and is the only person who captured every thoughtless remark, heated exchange, embarrassing detail, petty insult, and spiteful act of indifference.\" --John Cleese \"Kim ‘Howard\\' Johnson was invented by Graham Chapman during an idle moment on the set of The Life of Brian. ‘Let\\'s invent a person,\\' he said. ‘An American fan from the Midwest,\\' chimed in Michael Palin, ‘who keeps a daily diary of Python filming. And then doesn\\'t publish it for years and years.\\' How we laughed, and each day we\\'d make up stuff this ‘person\\' would write about us.\" --Eric Idle In 1978, Kim \"Howard\" Johnson ran away to join the circus---Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus, that is. The Pythons converged on Tunisia to film their timeless classic, Life of Brian, and Howard found himself in the thick of it, doubling for nearly all the Pythons, playing more roles in the film than John Cleese, and managing to ruin only one shot. He became the unit journalist, substitute still photographer, Roman soldier, peasant, Biggus Dickus\\'s double, near-stalker, and, ultimately, friend and confidant of the comedy legends. He also kept a detailed journal of what he saw and heard, on set and off, throughout those six weeks. The result is a unique eyewitness account that reveals the Pythons at work and at play in a way that nothing else written about them could do. Now, for the first time ever, the inside story of the making of the film is revealed through the fly-on-the-castle-wall perspective. Even the most diehard fans will get a fresh take on the comedy greats through some never-before-revealed nuggets of Python brilliance: what John Cleese offered to exchange for suntan lotion; Terry Jones directing in drag; Michael Palin\\'s secret to playing revolutionaries and peasants; Graham Chapman gets naked; Terry Gilliam gets filthy; Eric Idle haggles; the secret of the Thespo-Squat; Mrs. Pilate; talk of George Harrison; the cake-flinging that jeopardized the production; badminton, impromptu cricket, and erotic frescoes; and the first-ever presentation of \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Here, uncensored, are the legendary Pythons in their prime. It was a period of comedy history that will never be duplicated, and Monty Python\\'s Tunisian Holiday captures the wit, the genius, and the sheer silliness of the six men that comprised Python.',\n",

This book will help you master the basics and the advanced of parallel computing. What You Will Learn Synchronize multiple threads and processes to manage parallel tasks Implement message passing communication between processes to build parallel applications Program your own GPU cards to address complex problems Manage computing entities to execute distributed computational tasks Write efficient programs by adopting the event-driven programming model Explore the cloud technology with DJango and Google App Engine Apply parallel programming techniques that can lead to performance improvements In Detail Parallel programming techniques are required for a developer to get the best use of all the computational resources available today and to build efficient software systems. From multi-core to GPU systems up to the distributed architectures, the high computation of programs throughout requires the use of programming tools and software libraries. Because of this, it is becoming increasingly important to know what the parallel programming techniques are. Python is commonly used as even non-experts can easily deal with its concepts. This book will teach you parallel programming techniques using examples in Python and will help you explore the many ways in which you can write code that allows more than one process to happen at once. Starting with introducing you to the world of parallel computing, it moves on to cover the fundamentals in Python. This is followed by exploring the thread-based parallelism model using the Python threading module by synchronizing threads and using locks, mutex, semaphores queues, GIL, and the thread pool. Next you will be taught about process-based parallelism where you will synchronize processes using message passing along with learning about the performance of MPI Python Modules. You will then go on to learn the asynchronous parallel programming model using the Python asyncio module along with handling exceptions. Moving on, you will discover distributed computing with Python, and learn how to install a broker, use Celery Python Module, and create a worker. You will also understand the StarCluster framework, Pycsp, Scoop, and Disco modules in Python. Further on, you will learn GPU programming with Python using the PyCUDA module along with evaluating performance limitations. Next you will get acquainted with the cloud computing concepts in Python, using Google App Engine (GAE), and building your first application with GAE. Lastly, you will learn about grid computing concepts in Python and using PyGlobus toolkit, GFTP and GASS COPY to transfer files, and service monitoring in PyGlobus. Style and approach A step-by-step guide to parallel programming using Python, with recipes accompanied by one or more programming examples. It is a practically oriented book and has all the necessary underlying parallel computing concepts.',\n",

       "     'description': 'Discover the practical aspects of implementing deep-learning solutions using the rich Python ecosystem. This book bridges the gap between the academic state-of-the-art and the industry state-of-the-practice by introducing you to deep learning frameworks such as Keras, Theano, and Caffe. The practicalities of these frameworks is often acquired by practitioners by reading source code, manuals, and posting questions on community forums, which tends to be a slow and a painful process. Deep Learning with Python allows you to ramp up to such practical know-how in a short period of time and focus more on the domain, models, and algorithms. This book briefly covers the mathematical prerequisites and fundamentals of deep learning, making this book a good starting point for software developers who want to get started in deep learning. A brief survey of deep learning architectures is also included. Deep Learning with Python also introduces you to key concepts of automatic differentiation and GPU computation which, while not central to deep learning, are critical when it comes to conducting large scale experiments. What You Will Learn Leverage deep learning frameworks in Python namely, Keras, Theano, and Caffe Gain the fundamentals of deep learning with mathematical prerequisites Discover the practical considerations of large scale experiments Take deep learning models to production Who This Book Is For Software developers who want to try out deep learning as a practical solution to a particular problem.

Concurrency and parallelism in Python are essential when it comes to multiprocessing and multithreading; they behave differently, but their common aim is to reduce the execution time. This book serves as a comprehensive introduction to various advanced concepts in concurrent engineering and programming. Mastering Concurrency in Python starts by introducing the concepts and principles in concurrency, right from Amdahl's Law to multithreading programming, followed by elucidating multiprocessing programming, web scraping, and asynchronous I/O, together with common problems that engineers and programmers face in concurrent programming. Next, the book covers a number of advanced concepts in Python concurrency and how they interact with the Python ecosystem, including the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Finally, you'll learn how to solve real-world concurrency problems through examples. By the end of the book, you will have gained extensive theoretical knowledge of concurrency and the ways in which concurrency is supported by the Python language What you will learnExplore the concepts of concurrency in programmingExplore the core syntax and features that enable concurrency in PythonUnderstand the correct way to implement concurrencyAbstract methods to keep the data consistent in your programAnalyze problems commonly faced in concurrent programmingUse application scaffolding to design highly-scalable programsWho this book is for This book is for developers who wish to build high-performance applications and learn about signle-core, multicore programming or distributed concurrency.

       "     'description': \"As a follow-up to their first true feature film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the comic troupe next decided to tackle a “shadow” version of the Christ story. Shot in the Middle East and produced during Margaret Thatcher’s ascendant years, the film satirized—among other matters—authoritarianism and religious zealotry. Upon its release, Monty Python’s Life of Brian was both a critical and commercial success, and has been since hailed as one of the greatest comedies of all time. But the film also faced backlash from religious groups for its blasphemy, perceived or otherwise. In A Book about the Film Monty Python's Life of Brian: All of the References from Assyrians to Zeffirelli, Darl Larsen identifies and examines the plethora of cultural, historical, and topical allusions in the film. In this resource, Larsen delineates virtually every allusion and reference that appears in the film—from first-century Jerusalem through 1970s Great Britain. Organized chronologically by scene, the entries in this cultural history cover literary and metaphoric allusions, symbolisms, names, peoples, and places, as well as the many social, cultural, and historical elements that populate this film. By closely examining each scene, this book explores the Pythons’ comparisons of the Roman and British Empires and of Pilate and Margaret Thatcher. In addition, Larsen helps to situate Life of Brian in the “Jesus” re-examination of the postwar period, while also taking a close look at the terror groups of first-century Judea and the modern world. A Book about the Film Monty Python's Life of Brian will appeal to scholars of history, film, British culture, and pop culture, as well as to the many fans of this iconic group.\",\n",

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you\\'ll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python\\'s great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python\\'s newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft\\'s newIronPython project. Our \"Nutshell\" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes: A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions A quick reference for Python\\'s built-in types and functionsand key modules Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter Information about extending and embedding Python Python in a Nutshell provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost. This book will immediately earn its place in any Pythonprogrammer\\'s library. Praise for the First Edition: \"In a nutshell, Python in a Nutshell serves oneprimary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Pythonlanguage. True, you can get most of the same core information that ispresented within the covers of this volume online, but this willinvariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lackingthe examples or the exact syntax description necessary to trulyunderstand a command.\" --Richard Cobbett, Linux Format \"O\\'Reilly has several good books, of which Python in aNutshell by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving yousome idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it.\" --Jerry Pournelle, Byte Magazine',\n",

Do you want to go an extra mile and learn techniques to make your Python application robust, extensible, and efficient? Then this book is for you.What You Will Learn- Build a robust application by handling exceptions.- Modularize, package, and release the source distribution.- Document the code and implement coding standards.- Create automated tests to catch bugs in the early development stage.- Identify and re-factor badly written code to improve application life.- Detect recurring problems in the code and apply design patterns.- Improve code efficiency by identifying performance bottlenecks and fixing them.- Develop simple GUI applications using Python.In DetailPython is one of the most widely used dynamic programming languages, supported by a rich set of libraries and frameworks that enable rapid development. But fast paced development often comes with its own baggage that could bring down the quality, performance, and extensibility of an application. This book will show you ways to handle such problems and write better Python applications.From the basics of simple command-line applications, develop your skills all the way to designing efficient and advanced Python apps. Guided by a light-hearted fantasy learning theme, overcome the real-world problems of complex Python development with practical solutions. Beginning with a focus on robustness, packaging, and releasing application code, you'll move on to focus on improving application lifetime by making code extensible, reusable, and readable. Get to grips with Python refactoring, design patterns and best practices. Techniques to identify the bottlenecks and improve performance are covered in a series of chapters devoted to performance, before closing with a look at developing Python GUIs.Style and approachThe book uses a fantasy game theme as a medium to explain various topics. Specific aspects of application development are explained in different chapters. In each chapter the reader is presented with an interesting problem which is then tackled using hands-on examples with easy-to-follow instructions.\",\n",

By improving readers’ knowledge of image acquisition techniques and corresponding image processing, the book will help them perform experiments more effectively and cost efficiently as well as analyze and measure more accurately. Long recognized as one of the easiest languages for non-programmers to learn, Python is used in a variety of practical examples. A refresher for more experienced readers, the first part of the book presents an introduction to Python, Python modules, reading and writing images using Python, and an introduction to images. The second part discusses the basics of image processing, including pre/post processing using filters, segmentation, morphological operations, and measurements. The last part describes image acquisition using various modalities, such as x-ray, CT, MRI, light microscopy, and electron microscopy.

You’ll learn how to write and run tests before building each part of your app, and then develop the minimum amount of code required to pass those tests. The result? Clean code that works. In the process, you’ll learn the basics of Django, Selenium, Git, jQuery, and Mock, along with current web development techniques. If you’re ready to take your Python skills to the next level, this book—updated for Python 3.6—clearly demonstrates how TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence. Dive into the TDD workflow, including the unit test/code cycle and refactoring Use unit tests for classes and functions, and functional tests for user interactions within the browser Learn when and how to use mock objects, and the pros and cons of isolated vs. integrated tests Test and automate your deployments with a staging server Apply tests to the third-party plugins you integrate into your site Run tests automatically by using a Continuous Integration environment Use TDD to build a REST API with a front-end Ajax interface',\n",

Based on example applications, this book introduces various kinds of testing and shows you how to set up automated systems that run these tests, and install applications in different environments in controlled ways. Python Continuous Integration and Delivery tackles the technical problems related to software development that are typically glossed over in pure programming texts. After reading this book, you’ll see that in today's fast-moving world, no software project can afford to go through development, then an integration phase of unpredictable length and complexity, and finally be shipped to the customer -- just to find out that the resulting application didn't quite fill their need. Instead, you’ll discover that practicing continuous integration and continuous delivery reduces the risks by keeping changes small and automating otherwise painful processes. What You Will LearnCarry out various kinds of testing, including unit testing and continuous integration testing, of your Python code using Jenkins Build packages and manage repositories Incorporate Ansible and Go for automated packaging and other deployments Manage more complex and robust deployments Who This Book Is For Python programmers and operating staff that work with Python applications.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'This book provides insights into smart ways of computer log data analysis, with the goal of spotting adversarial actions. It is organized into 3 major parts with a total of 8 chapters that include a detailed view on existing solutions, as well as novel techniques that go far beyond state of the art. The first part of this book motivates the entire topic and highlights major challenges, trends and design criteria for log data analysis approaches, and further surveys and compares the state of the art. The second part of this book introduces concepts that apply character-based, rather than token-based, approaches and thus work on a more fine-grained level. Furthermore, these solutions were designed for “online use”, not only forensic analysis, but also process new log lines as they arrive in an efficient single pass manner. An advanced method for time series analysis aims at detecting changes in the overall behavior profile of an observed system and spotting trends and periodicities through log analysis. The third part of this book introduces the design of the AMiner, which is an advanced open source component for log data anomaly mining. The AMiner comes with several detectors to spot new events, new parameters, new correlations, new values and unknown value combinations and can run as stand-alone solution or as sensor with connection to a SIEM solution. More advanced detectors help to determines the characteristics of variable parts of log lines, specifically the properties of numerical and categorical fields. Detailed examples throughout this book allow the reader to better understand and apply the introduced techniques with open source software. Step-by-step instructions help to get familiar with the concepts and to better comprehend their inner mechanisms. A log test data set is available as free download and enables the reader to get the system up and running in no time. This book is designed for researchers working in the field of cyber security, and specifically system monitoring, anomaly detection and intrusion detection. The content of this book will be particularly useful for advanced-level students studying computer science, computer technology, and information systems. Forward-thinking practitioners, who would benefit from becoming familiar with the advanced anomaly detection methods, will also be interested in this book.',\n",

This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.',\n",

       "     'description': \"The official book on the Rust programming language, written by the Rust development team at the Mozilla Foundation, fully updated for Rust 2018. The Rust Programming Language is the official book on Rust: an open source systems programming language that helps you write faster, more reliable software. Rust offers control over low-level details (such as memory usage) in combination with high-level ergonomics, eliminating the hassle traditionally associated with low-level languages. The authors of The Rust Programming Language, members of the Rust Core Team, share their knowledge and experience to show you how to take full advantage of Rust's features--from installation to creating robust and scalable programs. You'll begin with basics like creating functions, choosing data types, and binding variables and then move on to more advanced concepts, such as: Ownership and borrowing, lifetimes, and traits Using Rust's memory safety guarantees to build fast, safe programs Testing, error handling, and effective refactoring Generics, smart pointers, multithreading, trait objects, and advanced pattern matching Using Cargo, Rust's built-in package manager, to build, test, and document your code and manage dependencies How best to use Rust's advanced compiler with compiler-led programming techniques You'll find plenty of code examples throughout the book, as well as three chapters dedicated to building complete projects to test your learning: a number guessing game, a Rust implementation of a command line tool, and a multithreaded server. New to this edition: An extended section on Rust macros, an expanded chapter on modules, and appendixes on Rust development tools and editions.\",\n",

What exactly is machine learning and why is it so valuable in the online business world? Simply put, it is a method of data analysis that uses algorithms that learn from data and produce specific results without being specifically programmed to do so. These algorithms can analyze data, calculate how frequently certain parts of it are used and generate responses based on this calculations in order to automatically interact with users. Throughout the recent years, artificial intelligence and machine learning have made some enormous, significant strides in terms of universal, global applicability. The ability to now be able to apply such algorithms via traditional and new dynamic programming languages allows us to interpret and understand these approaches much more eloquently. The main topics: -Why Machine Learning -Machine Learning And Artificial Intelligence -Some of the branches of Artificial Intelligence -Keras CNN Model for Deep Learning Predictions on AMZN Applying Logistic Regression to U.S. Equity Markets for Predictive Trading Python Machine Learning Applied To Financial Markets -What Python is and how to get started with it -What input and output mean in Python -The way that Python evolved throughout time After reading this book you will be able to implement machine learning and deep learning using Python While machine and deep learning algorithms have become a common measure for significant model performance across multiple industries, the primary focus of this book will be to better understand how such algorithms are being applied specifically via financial markets through the usage of the Python programming language.',\n",

Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne’s Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach is the ideal modern introduction to computer science with Java programming for both students and professionals. Taking a broad, applications-based approach, Sedgewick and Wayne teach through important examples from science, mathematics, engineering, finance, and commercial computing. The book demystifies computation, explains its intellectual underpinnings, and covers the essential elements of programming and computational problem solving in today’s environments. The authors begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, they turn to functions, introducing key modular programming concepts, including components and reuse. They present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming, covering current programming paradigms and approaches to data abstraction. Building on this foundation, Sedgewick and Wayne widen their focus to the broader discipline of computer science. They introduce classical sorting and searching algorithms, fundamental data structures and their application, and scientific techniques for assessing an implementation’s performance. Using abstract models, readers learn to answer basic questions about computation, gaining insight for practical application. Finally, the authors show how machine architecture links the theory of computing to real computers, and to the field’s history and evolution. For each concept, the authors present all the information readers need to build confidence, together with examples that solve intriguing problems. Each chapter contains question-and-answer sections, self-study drills, and challenging problems that demand creative solutions. Companion web site (introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java) contains Extensive supplementary information, including suggested approaches to programming assignments, checklists, and FAQs Graphics and sound libraries Links to program code and test data Solutions to selected exercises Chapter summaries Detailed instructions for installing a Java programming environment Detailed problem sets and projects Companion 20-part series of video lectures is available at informit.com/title/9780134493831',\n",

       "     'description': 'There are many distinct pleasures associated with computer programming. Craftsmanship has its quiet rewards, the satisfaction that comes from building a useful object and making it work. Excitement arrives with the flash of insight that cracks a previously intractable problem. The spiritual quest for elegance can turn the hacker into an artist. There are pleasures in parsimony, in squeezing the last drop of performance out of clever algorithms and tight coding. The games, puzzles, and challenges of problems from international programming competitions are a great way to experience these pleasures while improving your algorithmic and coding skills. This book contains over 100 problems that have appeared in previous programming contests, along with discussions of the theory and ideas necessary to attack them. Instant online grading for all of these problems is available from two WWW robot judging sites. Combining this book with a judge gives an exciting new way to challenge and improve your programming skills. This book can be used for self-study, for teaching innovative courses in algorithms and programming, and in training for international competition. The problems in this book have been selected from over 1,000 programming problems at the Universidad de Valladolid online judge. The judge has ruled on well over one million submissions from 27,000 registered users around the world to date. We have taken only the best of the best, the most fun, exciting, and interesting problems available.',\n",

This book is also useful for generic software developers who want to deploy computer vision applications on the cloud. It would be helpful to have some familiarity with basic mathematical concepts such as vectors, matrices, and so on.What You Will Learn• Apply geometric transformations to images, perform image filtering, and convert an image into a cartoon-like image• Detect and track various body parts such as the face, nose, eyes, ears, and mouth• Stitch multiple images of a scene together to create a panoramic image• Make an object disappear from an image• Identify different shapes, segment an image, and track an object in a live video• Recognize an object in an image and build a visual search engine• Reconstruct a 3D map from images• Build an augmented reality applicationIn DetailComputer vision is found everywhere in modern technology. OpenCV for Python enables us to run computer vision algorithms in real time. With the advent of powerful machines, we are getting more processing power to work with. Using this technology, we can seamlessly integrate our computer vision applications into the cloud. Web developers can develop complex applications without having to reinvent the wheel.This book will walk you through all the building blocks needed to build amazing computer vision applications with ease. We start off with applying geometric transformations to images. We then discuss affine and projective transformations and see how we can use them to apply cool geometric effects to photos. We will then cover techniques used for object recognition, 3D reconstruction, stereo imaging, and other computer vision applications.This book will also provide clear examples written in Python to build OpenCV applications. The book starts off with simple beginner's level tasks such as basic processing and handling images, image mapping, and detecting images. It also covers popular OpenCV libraries with the help of examples.The book is a practical tutorial that covers various examples at different levels, teaching you about the different functions of OpenCV and their actual implementation.Style and approachThis is a conversational-style book filled with hands-on examples that are really easy to understand. Each topic is explained very clearly and is followed by a programmatic implementation so that the concept is solidified. Each topic contributes to something bigger in the following chapters, which helps you understand how to piece things together to build something big and complex.\",\n",

After a crash course in Python programming basics, you’ll learn to make, test, and hack programs that encrypt text with classical ciphers like the transposition cipher and Vigenère cipher. You’ll begin with simple programs for the reverse and Caesar ciphers and then work your way up to public key cryptography, the type of encryption used to secure today’s online transactions, including digital signatures, email, and Bitcoin. Each program includes the full code and a line-by-line explanation of how things work. By the end of the book, you’ll have learned how to code in Python and you’ll have the clever programs to prove it! You’ll also learn how to: - Combine loops, variables, and flow control statements into real working programs - Use dictionary files to instantly detect whether decrypted messages are valid English or gibberish - Create test programs to make sure that your code encrypts and decrypts correctly - Code (and hack!) a working example of the affine cipher, which uses modular arithmetic to encrypt a message - Break ciphers with techniques such as brute-force and frequency analysis There’s no better way to learn to code than to play with real programs. Cracking Codes with Python makes the learning fun!',\n",

       "     'description': \"A comprehensive introduction to machine learning that uses probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package—PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)—that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.\",\n",

       "     'description': \"The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them. The topics covered include · Dividing an enterprise application into layers · The major approaches to organizing business logic · An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases · Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation · Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions · Designing distributed object interfaces\",\n",

Natural Language Processing with Python and spaCy will show you how to create NLP applications like chatbots, text-condensing scripts, and order-processing tools quickly and easily. You\\'ll learn how to leverage the spaCy library to extract meaning from text intelligently; how to determine the relationships between words in a sentence (syntactic dependency parsing); identify nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech (part-of-speech tagging); and sort proper nouns into categories like people, organizations, and locations (named entity recognizing). You\\'ll even learn how to transform statements into questions to keep a conversation going. You\\'ll also learn how to: • Work with word vectors to mathematically find words with similar meanings (Chapter 5) • Identify patterns within data using spaCy\\'s built-in displaCy visualizer (Chapter 7) • Automatically extract keywords from user input and store them in a relational database (Chapter 9) • Deploy a chatbot app to interact with users over the internet (Chapter 11) \"Try This\" sections in each chapter encourage you to practice what you\\'ve learned by expanding the book\\'s example scripts to handle a wider range of inputs, add error handling, and build professional-quality applications. By the end of the book, you\\'ll be creating your own NLP applications with Python and spaCy.',\n",

       "     'description': 'Through narrating the politics and everyday life in ex-British Southern Cameroons (Ambazonia), Porcupine in a Python’s Throatmakes an invaluable contribution to understanding the choices and constraints facing both Southern Cameroons’ (Ambazonia) people, and the people of Republique du Cameroun. The volume illustrates how the people of ex-British Southern Cameroons’ (Ambazonia) seek alternatives to the cycles of repression and state terrorism turned into reprisal, retaliation and a genocidal war from 2016. This volume challenges the authorities over delimited territories and their inhabitants in states arbitrarily put together and held together by external power and control. The editor and contributors argue that the Westphalian sovereignty of authority as indivisible in postcolonial and other settings is unworkable, and does not last very long in plural societies put together and sustained with the use of force.',\n",

As Python is such a great and easy to learn language, this book is also ideal for any developer with experience of other languages and enthusiasm to expand their horizon.What you will learn* Create the GUI Form and add widgets* Arrange the widgets using layout managers* Use object-oriented programming to create GUIs* Create Matplotlib charts* Use threads and talking to networks* Talk to a MySQL database via the GUI* Perform unit-testing and internationalizing the GUI* Extend the GUI with third-party graphical libraries* Get to know the best practices to create GUIsIn DetailExplore the beautiful world of GUI development using the Python programming language. You will learn how easy it is to get started and you might be surprised how advanced you can become in just a short time of coding. GUI development using Python is not a very well-known subject. The built-in tkinter GUI framework was limited, but with the latest versions of Python 3 and tkinter, all of this has dramatically changed.This book will guide you from the very basics of creating a fully functional GUI in Python with only a few lines of code. Each and every recipe adds more widgets to the GUIs we are creating. While the cookbook recipes all stand on their own, there is a common theme running through all of them. As our GUIs keep expanding, using more and more widgets, we start to talk to networks, databases, and graphical libraries that greatly enhance our GUI's functionality.\",\n",

The original Python Library Reference book is 1920 pages long. This book contains the original page numbers and index, along with the back sections fully intact. While reference-index describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions. Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.

OpenCV for Python enables us to run computer vision algorithms in real time. With the advent of powerful machines, we have more processing power to work with. Using this technology, we can seamlessly integrate our computer vision applications into the cloud. Focusing on OpenCV 3.x and Python 3.6, this book will walk you through all the building blocks needed to build amazing computer vision applications with ease. We start off by manipulating images using simple filtering and geometric transformations. We then discuss affine and projective transformations and see how we can use them to apply cool advanced manipulations to your photos like resizing them while keeping the content intact or smoothly removing undesired elements. We will then cover techniques of object tracking, body part recognition, and object recognition using advanced techniques of machine learning such as artificial neural network. 3D reconstruction and augmented reality techniques are also included. The book covers popular OpenCV libraries with the help of examples. This book is a practical tutorial that covers various examples at different levels, teaching you about the different functions of OpenCV and their actual implementation. By the end of this book, you will have acquired the skills to use OpenCV and Python to develop real-world computer vision applications. What you will learn Detect shapes and edges from images and videos How to apply filters on images and videos Use different techniques to manipulate and improve images Extract and manipulate particular parts of images and videos Track objects or colors from videos Recognize specific object or faces from images and videos How to create Augmented Reality applications Apply artificial neural networks and machine learning to improve object recognition Who this book is for This book is intended for Python developers who are new to OpenCV and want to develop computer vision applications with OpenCV and Python.

You can remain a passive participant, or you can learn to code. With Head First Learn to Code youÃ¢??ll learn how to think computationally and how to write code to make your computer, mobile device, or anything with a CPU do things for you. Using the Python programming language, youÃ¢??ll learn step by step the core concepts of programming as well as many fundamental topics from computer science, such as data structures, storage, abstraction, recursion, and modularity. Why does this book look so different? Based on the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory, Head First Learn to Code uses a visually rich format to engage your mind, rather than a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep. Why waste your time struggling with new concepts? This multi-sensory learning experience is designed for the way your brain really works.',\n",

       "     'description': \"Build real-world computer vision applications and develop cool demos using OpenCV for Python About This Book Learn how to apply complex visual effects to images using geometric transformations and image filters Extract features from an image and use them to develop advanced applications Build algorithms to help you understand the image content and perform visual searches Who This Book Is For This book is intended for Python developers who are new to OpenCV and want to develop computer vision applications with OpenCV-Python. This book is also useful for generic software developers who want to deploy computer vision applications on the cloud. It would be helpful to have some familiarity with basic mathematical concepts such as vectors, matrices, and so on. What You Will Learn Apply geometric transformations to images, perform image filtering, and convert an image into a cartoon-like image Detect and track various body parts such as the face, nose, eyes, ears, and mouth Stitch multiple images of a scene together to create a panoramic image Make an object disappear from an image Identify different shapes, segment an image, and track an object in a live video Recognize an object in an image and build a visual search engine Reconstruct a 3D map from images Build an augmented reality application In Detail Computer vision is found everywhere in modern technology. OpenCV for Python enables us to run computer vision algorithms in real time. With the advent of powerful machines, we are getting more processing power to work with. Using this technology, we can seamlessly integrate our computer vision applications into the cloud. Web developers can develop complex applications without having to reinvent the wheel. This book will walk you through all the building blocks needed to build amazing computer vision applications with ease. We start off with applying geometric transformations to images. We then discuss affine and projective transformations and see how we can use them to apply cool geometric effects to photos. We will then cover techniques used for object recognition, 3D reconstruction, stereo imaging, and other computer vision applications. This book will also provide clear examples written in Python to build OpenCV applications. The book starts off with simple beginner's level tasks such as basic processing and handling images, image mapping, and detecting images. It also covers popular OpenCV libraries with the help of examples. The book is a practical tutorial that covers various examples at different levels, teaching you about the different functions of OpenCV and their actual implementation. Style and approach This is a conversational-style book filled with hands-on examples that are really easy to understand. Each topic is explained very clearly and is followed by a programmatic implementation so that the concept is solidified. Each topic contributes to something bigger in the following chapters, which helps you understand how to piece things together to build something big and complex.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'Pro Python System Administration, Second Edition explains and shows how to apply Python scripting in practice. It will show you how to approach and resolve real-world issues that most system administrators will come across in their careers. This book has been updated using Python 2.7 and Python 3 where appropriate. It also uses various new and relevant open source projects and tools that should now be used in practice. In this updated edition, you will find several projects in the categories of network administration, web server administration, and monitoring and database management. In each project, the author will define the problem, design the solution, and go through the more interesting implementation steps. Each project is accompanied by the source code of a fully working prototype, which you’ll be able to use immediately or adapt to your requirements and environment. This book is primarily aimed at experienced system administrators whose day-to-day tasks involve looking after and managing small-to-medium-sized server estates. It will also be beneficial for system administrators who want to learn more about automation and want to apply their Python knowledge to solve various system administration problems. Python developers will also benefit from reading this book, especially if they are involved in developing automation and management tools.',\n",

It can also be used as a standalone workbook for you to test and improve your knowledge of the Python syntax.What this book offers...Carefully designed questionsEach question in this workbook is crafted to help you gradually build your programming skills, focusing on one or two concepts at a time and increasing in level of difficulty as we progress through the chapters.Clear and Easy to Understand SolutionsAll solutions in this book are extensively tested by a group of beta readers. The solutions provided are simplified as much as possible so that they can serve as examples for you to refer to when you are learning a new syntax.Two Projects to Consolidate Your LearningThis workbook also includes two projects at the end to help you consolidate your learning. While the individual chapters prior to the projects help you learn one concept at a time, these two projects require the application of multiple concepts covered in previous chapters and allow you to see how everything works together.What this book aims to do...This workbook is written with one goal in mind - to help new programmers overcome their initial obstacles to learning.A lot of times, when new programmers look at code written by other programmers, they tend to feel intimidated as a lot of the code looks complicated to them. A complete program written by other programmers incorporates many different concepts.The goal of this workbook is to isolate the different concepts so that new programmers can gradually gain competency in the fundamentals of the language before working on bigger projects at the end of the book. Programming does not have to be scary or frustrating when you take one step at a time.Ready to start practicing and building your Python skills?

It worked so well for me that I've used it to teach coding to grandmothers, cab drivers, musicians, and 50,000 other newbies. Washington University research shows that a key teaching method I use--interactive recall practice--improves learning performance 400 percent. Computer languages are not inherently hard to understand, even for non-techies. Remembering is the problem. Research shows that you will remember everything if you're repeatedly asked to recall it. That's the beauty of flash cards. But technology offers an even better way to make information stick. With my book you get almost a thousand interactive exercises--they're free online--that embed the whole book in your memory. Algorithms check your work to make sure you know what you think you know. When you stumble, you do the exercise again. You keep trying until you know the chapter cold. The exercises keep you engaged, give you extra practice where you're shaky, and prepare you for each next step. Every lesson is built on top of a solid foundation that you and I have carefully constructed. Each individual step is small. But all the little steps add up to real knowledge--knowledge that you retain. You don't need to be a computer genius to learn Python. You just need to be smart about how you learn it.--Amazon.com description.\",\n",

Odoo's layered module approach makes it particularly effective for combining and extending features. This updated fifth edition is a tutorial-style introduction to essential Odoo development topics. The book starts by covering the development essentials for building business applications and takes you through Odoo installation and configuration, gradually transitioning from having no specific knowledge of Odoo to being ready for application development. You'll then learn how to develop your first Odoo application, while covering topics such as models and views. Later chapters will get you up to speed with using server APIs to add business logic, helping you lay a solid foundation for advanced topics. As you progress, you'll get equipped to build and customize your applications and explore the new features available in Odoo 12 and beyond, such as in-memory ORM and computed writable fields. Finally, you'll gain insights into building business logic and using the Odoo API to integrate with various applications. By the end of this book, you'll be able to build business apps from scratch using the latest version of Odoo.

Computer vision is key to technologies like object recognition, shape detection, and depth estimation. OpenCV is an open-source library with over 2500 algorithms that you can use to do all of these, as well as track moving objects, extract 3D models, and overlay augmented reality. It's used by major companies like Google (in its autonomous car), Intel, and Sony; and it is the backbone of the Robot Operating System’s computer vision capability. In short, if you're working with computer vision at all, you need to know OpenCV. With Practical OpenCV, you'll be able to: Get OpenCV up and running on Windows or Linux. Use OpenCV to control the camera board and run vision algorithms on Raspberry Pi. Understand what goes on behind the scenes in computer vision applications like object detection, image stitching, filtering, stereo vision, and more. Code complex computer vision projects for your class/hobby/robot/job, many of which can execute in real time on off-the-shelf processors. Combine different modules that you develop to create your own interactive computer vision app.\",\n",

Master the Powerful Python 3 Standard Library through Real Code Examples “The genius of Doug’s approach is that with 15 minutes per week, any motivated programmer can learn the Python Standard Library. Doug’s guided tour will help you flip the switch to fully power-up Python’s batteries.” –Raymond Hettinger, Distinguished Python Core Developer The Python 3 Standard Library contains hundreds of modules for interacting with the operating system, interpreter, and Internet–all extensively tested and ready to jump-start application development. Now, Python expert Doug Hellmann introduces every major area of the Python 3.x library through concise source code and output examples. Hellmann’s examples fully demonstrate each feature and are designed for easy learning and reuse. You’ll find practical code for working with text, data structures, algorithms, dates/times, math, the file system, persistence, data exchange, compression, archiving, crypto, processes/threads, networking, Internet capabilities, email, developer and language tools, the runtime, packages, and more. Each section fully covers one module, with links to additional resources, making this book an ideal tutorial and reference. The Python 3 Standard Library by Example introduces Python 3.x’s new libraries, significant functionality changes, and new layout and naming conventions. Hellmann also provides expert porting guidance for moving code from 2.x Python standard library modules to their Python 3.x equivalents. Manipulate text with string, textwrap, re (regular expressions), and difflib Use data structures: enum, collections, array, heapq, queue, struct, copy, and more Implement algorithms elegantly and concisely with functools, itertools, and contextlib Handle dates/times and advanced mathematical tasks Archive and data compression Understand data exchange and persistence, including json, dbm, and sqlite Sign and verify messages cryptographically Manage concurrent operations with processes and threads Test, debug, compile, profile, language, import, and package tools Control interaction at runtime with interpreters or the environment',\n",

Survival Analysis with Python takes a fresh look at this complex subject by explaining how to use the Python programming language to perform this type of analysis. As the subject itself is very mathematical and full of expressions and formulations, the book provides detailed explanations and examines practical implications. The book begins with an overview of the concepts underpinning statistical survival analysis. It then delves into Parametric models with coverage of Concept of maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of a probability distribution parameter MLE of the survival function Common probability distributions and their analysis Analysis of exponential distribution as a survival function Analysis of Weibull distribution as a survival function Derivation of Gumbel distribution as a survival function from Weibull Non-parametric models including Kaplan–Meier (KM) estimator, a derivation of expression using MLE Fitting KM estimator with an example dataset, Python code and plotting curves Greenwood’s formula and its derivation Models with covariates explaining The concept of time shift and the accelerated failure time (AFT) model Weibull-AFT model and derivation of parameters by MLE Proportional Hazard (PH) model Cox-PH model and Breslow’s method Significance of covariates Selection of covariates The Python lifelines library is used for coding examples.

This book takes the robotic \"turtle\" method, and extends it to the 3D, interactive world of Minecraft. You\\'ve mined for diamonds, crafted dozens of tools, and built all sorts of structures--but what if you could program robots to do all of that for you in a fraction of the time? In Coding with Minecraft®, you\\'ll create a virtual robot army with Lua, a programming language used by professional game developers. Step-by-step coding projects will show you how to write programs that automatically dig mines, collect materials, craft items, and build anything that you can imagine. Along the way, you\\'ll explore key computer science concepts like data types, functions, variables, and more. Learn how to: - Program robots that make smart decisions with flow control - Reuse code so that your robots can farm any crop you want, including wheat, sugar cane, and even cacti! - Program a factory that generates infinite building supplies - Design an algorithm for creating walls and buildings of any size - Code yourself a pickaxe-swinging robotic lumberjack! - Create a robot that digs mine shafts with stairs so you can explore safely Bonus activities in each chapter will help you take your coding skills to the next level. By the end of the book, you\\'ll understand how powerful coding can be and have plenty of robots at your beck and call.',\n",

       "     'description': 'The \"Writing Idiomatic Python\" book is finally here! Chock full of code samples, you\\'ll learn the \"Pythonic\" way to accomplish common tasks. Each idiom comes with a detailed description, example code showing the \"wrong\" way to do it, and code for the idiomatic, \"Pythonic\" alternative. *This version of the book is for Python 3. There is also a Python 2.7+ version available.* \"Writing Idiomatic Python\" contains the most common and important Python idioms in a format that maximizes identification and understanding. Each idiom is presented as a recommendation to write some commonly used piece of code. It is followed by an explanation of why the idiom is important. It also contains two code samples: the \"Harmful\" way to write it and the \"Idiomatic\" way. * The \"Harmful\" way helps you identify the idiom in your own code. * The \"Idiomatic\" way shows you how to easily translate that code into idiomatic Python. This book is perfect for you: * If you\\'re coming to Python from another programming language * If you\\'re learning Python as a first programming language * If you\\'re looking to increase the readability, maintainability, and correctness of your Python code What is \"Idiomatic\" Python? Every programming language has its own idioms. Programming language idioms are nothing more than the generally accepted way of writing a certain piece of code. Consistently writing idiomatic code has a number of important benefits: * Others can read and understand your code easily * Others can maintain and enhance your code with minimal effort * Your code will contain fewer bugs * Your code will teach others to write correct code without any effort on your part',\n",

If you are familiar with coding in Python (or some other programming/statistical/scripting language) but have never used or read about Predictive Analytics algorithms, this book will also help you. The book will be beneficial to and can be read by any Data Science enthusiasts. Some familiarity with Python will be useful to get the most out of this book, but it is certainly not a prerequisite. What You Will Learn Understand the statistical and mathematical concepts behind Predictive Analytics algorithms and implement Predictive Analytics algorithms using Python libraries Analyze the result parameters arising from the implementation of Predictive Analytics algorithms Write Python modules/functions from scratch to execute segments or the whole of these algorithms Recognize and mitigate various contingencies and issues related to the implementation of Predictive Analytics algorithms Get to know various methods of importing, cleaning, sub-setting, merging, joining, concatenating, exploring, grouping, and plotting data with pandas and numpy Create dummy datasets and simple mathematical simulations using the Python numpy and pandas libraries Understand the best practices while handling datasets in Python and creating predictive models out of them In Detail Social Media and the Internet of Things have resulted in an avalanche of data. Data is powerful but not in its raw form - It needs to be processed and modeled, and Python is one of the most robust tools out there to do so. It has an array of packages for predictive modeling and a suite of IDEs to choose from. Learning to predict who would win, lose, buy, lie, or die with Python is an indispensable skill set to have in this data age. This book is your guide to getting started with Predictive Analytics using Python. You will see how to process data and make predictive models from it. We balance both statistical and mathematical concepts, and implement them in Python using libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy. You'll start by getting an understanding of the basics of predictive modeling, then you will see how to cleanse your data of impurities and get it ready it for predictive modeling. You will also learn more about the best predictive modeling algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression. Finally, you will see the best practices in predictive modeling, as well as the different applications of predictive modeling in the modern world. Style and approach All the concepts in this book been explained and illustrated using a dataset, and in a step-by-step manner. The Python code snippet to implement a method or concept is followed by the output, such as charts, dataset heads, pictures, and so on. The statistical concepts are explained in detail wherever required.\",\n",

To my amazement, his books explain complicated code clearly enough for anyone to understand.” —Art Sedighi, PhD Tapping into the full power of Python doesn’t have to be difficult. Supercharged Python is written for people who’ve learned the fundamentals of the language but want to take their skills to the next level. After a quick review of Python, the book covers: advanced list and string techniques; all the ways to handle text and binary files; financial applications; advanced techniques for writing classes; generators and decorators; and how to master packages such as Numpy (Numeric Python) to supercharge your applications! Use profilers and “magic methods” to code like a pro Harness the power of regular expressions to process text quickly with a single statement Take advantage of 22 coding shortcuts, along with performance tips, to save time and optimize your code Create really useful classes and objects, for games, simulations, money, mathematics, and more Use multiple modules to build powerful apps while avoiding the “gotchas” Import packages to dramatically speed up statistical operations—by as much as 100 times! Refer to the five-part language reference to look up fine points of the language Supercharged Python demonstrates techniques that allow you to write faster and more powerful code, whether you’re manipulating large amounts of data or building sophisticated applications. Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available. See inside book for details.',\n",

Designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to data structures and algorithms, including their design, analysis, and implementation, the text will maintain the same general structure as Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and Data Structures and Algorithms in C++. Begins by discussing Python's conceptually simple syntax, which allows for a greater focus on concepts. Employs a consistent object-oriented viewpoint throughout the text. Presents each data structure using ADTs and their respective implementations and introduces important design patterns as a means to organize those implementations into classes, methods, and objects. Provides a thorough discussion on the analysis and design of fundamental data structures. Includes many helpful Python code examples, with source code provided on the website. Uses illustrations to present data structures and algorithms, as well as their analysis, in a clear, visual manner. Provides hundreds of exercises that promote creativity, help readers learn how to think like programmers, and reinforce important concepts. Contains many Python-code and pseudo-code fragments, and hundreds of exercises, which are divided into roughly 40% reinforcement exercises, 40% creativity exercises, and 20% programming projects.\",\n",

This book serves as a practical guide to developing a full-fledged decentralized application with Python to interact with the various building blocks of blockchain applications. Hands-On Blockchain for Python Developers starts by demonstrating how blockchain technology and cryptocurrency hashing works. You will understand the fundamentals and benefits of smart contracts such as censorship resistance and transaction accuracy. As you steadily progress, you'll go on to build smart contracts using Vyper, which has a similar syntax to Python. This experience will further help you unravel the other benefits of smart contracts, including reliable storage and backup, and efficiency. You'll also use web3.py to interact with smart contracts and leverage the power of both the web3.py and Populus framework to build decentralized applications that offer security and seamless integration with cryptocurrencies. As you explore later chapters, you'll learn how to create your own token on top of Ethereum and build a cryptocurrency wallet graphical user interface (GUI) that can handle Ethereum and Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC-20) tokens using the PySide2 library. This will enable users to seamlessly store, send, and receive digital money. Toward the end, you'll implement InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) technology in your decentralized application to provide a peer-to-peer filesystem that can store and expose media. By the end of this book, you'll be well-versed in blockchain programming and be able to build end-to-end decentralized applications on a range of domains using Python. What you will learnUnderstand blockchain technology and what makes it an immutable databaseUse the features of web3.py API to interact with the smart contractCreate your own cryptocurrency and token in Ethereum using VyperUse IPFS features to store content on the decentralized storage platformImplement a Twitter-like decentralized application with a desktop frontendBuild decentralized applications in the shape of console, web, and desktop applicationsWho this book is for If you are a Python developer who wants to enter the world of blockchain, Hands-On Blockchain for Python Developers is for you.

       "     'description': 'This book, fully updated for Python version 3.6+, covers the key ideas that link probability, statistics, and machine learning illustrated using Python modules in these areas. All the figures and numerical results are reproducible using the Python codes provided. The author develops key intuitions in machine learning by working meaningful examples using multiple analytical methods and Python codes, thereby connecting theoretical concepts to concrete implementations. Detailed proofs for certain important results are also provided. Modern Python modules like Pandas, Sympy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras are applied to simulate and visualize important machine learning concepts like the bias/variance trade-off, cross-validation, and regularization. Many abstract mathematical ideas, such as convergence in probability theory, are developed and illustrated with numerical examples. This updated edition now includes the Fisher Exact Test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test. A new section on survival analysis has been included as well as substantial development of Generalized Linear Models. The new deep learning section for image processing includes an in-depth discussion of gradient descent methods that underpin all deep learning algorithms. As with the prior edition, there are new and updated *Programming Tips* that the illustrate effective Python modules and methods for scientific programming and machine learning. There are 445 run-able code blocks with corresponding outputs that have been tested for accuracy. Over 158 graphical visualizations (almost all generated using Python) illustrate the concepts that are developed both in code and in mathematics. We also discuss and use key Python modules such as Numpy, Scikit-learn, Sympy, Scipy, Lifelines, CvxPy, Theano, Matplotlib, Pandas, Tensorflow, Statsmodels, and Keras.

While there are an increasing number of sophisticated, ready-made tools to scan systems for vulnerabilities, the use of Python allows you to write system-specific scripts, or alter and extend existing testing tools to find, exploit, and record as many security weaknesses as possible. Learning Python Web Penetration Testing will walk you through the web application penetration testing methodology, showing you how to write your own tools with Python for each activity throughout the process. The book begins by emphasizing the importance of knowing how to write your own tools with Python for web application penetration testing. You will then learn to interact with a web application using Python, understand the anatomy of an HTTP request, URL, headers and message body, and later create a script to perform a request, and interpret the response and its headers. As you make your way through the book, you will write a web crawler using Python and the Scrappy library. The book will also help you to develop a tool to perform brute force attacks in different parts of the web application. You will then discover more on detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities. By the end of this book, you will have successfully created an HTTP proxy based on the mitmproxy tool. What you will learn Interact with a web application using the Python and Requests libraries Create a basic web application crawler and make it recursive Develop a brute force tool to discover and enumerate resources such as files and directories Explore different authentication methods commonly used in web applications Enumerate table names from a database using SQL injection Understand the web application penetration testing methodology and toolkit Who this book is for Learning Python Web Penetration Testing is for web developers who want to step into the world of web application security testing.

By improving readers' knowledge of image acquisition techniques and corresponding image processing, the book will help them perform experiments more effectively and cost efficiently as well as analyze and measure more accurately. Long recognized as one of the easiest languages for non-programmers to learn, Python is used in a variety of practical examples. A refresher for more experienced readers, the first part of the book presents an introduction to Python, Python modules, reading and writing images using Python, and an introduction to images. The second part discusses the basics of image processing, including pre/post processing using filters, segmentation, morphological operations, and measurements. The second part describes image acquisition using various modalities, such as x-ray, CT, MRI, light microscopy, and electron microscopy. These modalities encompass most of the common image acquisition methods currently used by researchers in academia and industry. Features Covers both the physical methods of obtaining images and the analytical processing methods required to understand the science behind the images. Contains many examples, detailed derivations, and working Python examples of the techniques. Offers practical tips on image acquisition and processing. Includes numerous exercises to test the reader's skills in Python programming and image processing, with solutions to selected problems, example programs, and images available on the book's web page. New to this edition Machine learning has become an indispensable part of image processing and computer vision, so in this new edition two new chapters are included: one on neural networks and the other on convolutional neural networks. A new chapter on affine transform and many new algorithms. Updated Python code aligned to the latest version of modules.\",\n",

In this book, Thomas Christopher shows developers the best ways to write large programs with Python, introducing powerful design patterns that deliver unprecedented levels of robustness, scalability, and reuse. Python Programming Patterns teaches both the Python programming language and how to \"program in the large\" in Python, using object-oriented techniques. Thomas Christopher demonstrates how to write Python code that leverages \"programming-in-the-large\" software structuring techniques, including modularization, toolkits, frameworks, abstract data types, and especially object-orientation. He presents more than 20 powerful object-oriented design patterns for Python, including creational, structural, and behavior patterns. The book includes detailed coverage of key topics such as persistence, concurrent programming, and metaprogramming (Python\\'s term for reflection or introspection). Christopher also presents useful fun',\n",

Python is on the rise in the world of coding and many popular technological devices from the Raspberry Pi to the Linux operating system use Python as a crux for not just education, but implementation. Python can help you code your own software, develop your own games and even format your own home surveillance system! It is, hands down, one of the most useful coding languages around, and the way it is formatted cuts out a great deal of the fluff that other coding languages have a tendency to be bogged down with. Whether your interest in Python is educational, career-based, or born out of a simple curiosity, it is a programming language you should know, be fluent in, and put on your resume. This world is quickly evolving into a technology-based society, and knowing a coding language as prominent as Python will not only ensure you a job in the future, but it will provide you with a thick foundation to then build your coding language on, should that be something you are chasing. However, no matter the purpose you have chosen for learning this language, there is no beginner's book that breaks down the language into its original components and strings them together cohesively better than this one. If you are looking for a book that is easy to understand and still provides the easy to digest guidance you want, then look no further than here!\",\n",

The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs—in companies of all sizes—a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.',\n",

While most resources start with theory to teach this complex subject, this practical book introduces techniques by showing you how they’re applied in the real world. In the first chapter alone, you’ll be able to decompose a sound into its harmonics, modify the harmonics, and generate new sounds. Author Allen Downey explains techniques such as spectral decomposition, filtering, convolution, and the Fast Fourier Transform. This book also provides exercises and code examples to help you understand the material. You’ll explore: Periodic signals and their spectrums Harmonic structure of simple waveforms Chirps and other sounds whose spectrum changes over time Noise signals and natural sources of noise The autocorrelation function for estimating pitch The discrete cosine transform (DCT) for compression The Fast Fourier Transform for spectral analysis Relating operations in time to filters in the frequency domain Linear time-invariant (LTI) system theory Amplitude modulation (AM) used in radio Other books in this series include Think Stats and Think Bayes, also by Allen Downey.',\n",

       "     'description': \"Learn the ins and outs of decisions, biases, and reliability of AI algorithms and how to make sense of these predictions. This book explores the so-called black-box models to boost the adaptability, interpretability, and explainability of the decisions made by AI algorithms using frameworks such as Python XAI libraries, TensorFlow 2.0+, Keras, and custom frameworks using Python wrappers. You'll begin with an introduction to model explainability and interpretability basics, ethical consideration, and biases in predictions generated by AI models. Next, you'll look at methods and systems to interpret linear, non-linear, and time-series models used in AI. The book will also cover topics ranging from interpreting to understanding how an AI algorithm makes a decision Further, you will learn the most complex ensemble models, explainability, and interpretability using frameworks such as Lime, SHAP, Skater, ELI5, etc. Moving forward, you will be introduced to model explainability for unstructured data, classification problems, and natural language processing–related tasks. Additionally, the book looks at counterfactual explanations for AI models. Practical Explainable AI Using Python shines the light on deep learning models, rule-based expert systems, and computer vision tasks using various XAI frameworks. What You'll Learn Review the different ways of making an AI model interpretable and explainable Examine the biasness and good ethical practices of AI models Quantify, visualize, and estimate reliability of AI models Design frameworks to unbox the black-box models Assess the fairness of AI models Understand the building blocks of trust in AI models Increase the level of AI adoption Who This Book Is For AI engineers, data scientists, and software developers involved in driving AI projects/ AI products.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'Do you want to learn Computer Programming ?? ◆★★INCLUDES 6 MANUSCRIPTS★★◆ ★LEARN PYTHON PROGRAMMING★ In today\\'\\'s Industry, Python Programming is highly recommended for developing Websites. The creator of this programming language was Guido Van Rossum, released first in the year 1991. The multiple supporting programming paradigms made itself unique from other programming languages as it had some outstanding features like unique adaptability, the ability to adopt machine learning, scientific computation, cloud infrastructure and above all web development. Python\\'\\'s role is really commendable in both software development, as well as, web development. ★PYTHON CODING AND PROGRAMMING★ Python is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook. It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc., and those languages hire Python designs for their development. ★LINUX FOR BEGINNERS★ For computers, servers, mainframes, mobile, and embedded devices, Linux is an open-source and community-developed and operating system. As it is an open source OS, the code is free to create Linux. That\\'\\'s why the appropriate skills for the users are necessary, even if they are beginners, so that they can get the best out of the operating system. This is not only used by the web programmers but also by the regular computer or laptop users and even mobile phones. Get hold of the eBook to learn more. As it is a bit different from the popular operating system like Windows or Android, it takes a little bit of time to get the hang of it. ★SQL★ The truth is: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Many people scoff dubiously when it is announced that SQL is, indeed, a programming language. When people think of programming languages, all that comes to their mind are C++, Python, Java etc, People disregard SQL as a programming language because of its interface structure and limited functionality. However, they fail to understand that while C++, Python are third level programming languages, and hence more developed, it doesn\\'\\'t change the fact that SQL falls under the umbrella of programming languages. ★HTML★ HTML is changing so quickly it\\'\\'s practically difficult to stay aware of improvements. XHTML is HTML 4.0 revised in XML; it gives the exactness of XML while holding the adaptability of HTML. HTML and XHTML: The Definitive Guide, Fourth Edition, unites everything. It\\'\\'s the most exhaustive book accessible on HTML and XHTML today. It covers Netscape Navigator 6.0, Internet Explorer 5.0, HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, JavaScript, Style sheets, Layers, and the entirety of the highlights upheld by the mainstream internet browsers. ★C++★ C++ is an object orientated computer language created by remarkable computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as a part of the evolution of the C family of languages. A few call C++ \"C with Classes\" because it introduces object orientated programming principles, including using defined classes, to C program language period framework. C++ is stated \"see-plus-plus.\" ✓what are you waiting for ... ✓',\n",

Paul Ferrill leads you from installing the Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) to writing small scripts, to more complicated and interesting projects, and finally to uploading and packaging your programs to an Android device. Android runs scripts in many scripting languages, but Python, Lua, and Beanshell are particularly popular. Most programmers know more than one programming language, so that they have the best tool for whatever task they want to accomplish. Pro Android Python with SL4A explores the world of Android scripting by introducing you to the most important open-source programming languages that are available on Android-based hardware. Pro Android Python with SL4A starts by exploring the Android software development kit and then shows you how to set up an Eclipse-based Android development environment. You then approach the world of Android programming by using Beanshell, which runs on the Dalvik, and learning how to write small programs to administer an Android device. Next, discover how Lua, a lightweight language perfectly suited for scripting on smaller devices, can work with Android. Lua can be used for small but important tasks, like SMS encryption and synchronizing photos with flickr. Last, but certainly not least, you will discover the world of Python scripting for SL4A, and the power contained within the full range of Python modules that can combine with the Android SDK. You'll learn to write small location-aware apps to get you started, but by the end of this book, you'll find yourself writing fully GUI-fied applications running on the Android desktop! Pro Android Python with SL4A is rounded out with a chapter on distributing and packaging scripts, a skill that you'll find very useful as you reach out to a wider audience with your programs.\",\n",

Python One-Liners will teach you how to read and write \"one-liners\": concise statements of useful functionality packed into a single line of code. You\\'ll learn how to systematically unpack and understand any line of Python code, and write eloquent, powerfully compressed Python like an expert. The book\\'s five chapters cover tips and tricks, regular expressions, machine learning, core data science topics, and useful algorithms. Detailed explanations of one-liners introduce key computer science concepts and boost your coding and analytical skills. You\\'ll learn about advanced Python features such as list comprehension, slicing, lambda functions, regular expressions, map and reduce functions, and slice assignments. You\\'ll also learn how to: Leverage data structures to solve real-world problems, like using Boolean indexing to find cities with above-average pollution Use NumPy basics such as array, shape, axis, type, broadcasting, advanced indexing, slicing, sorting, searching, aggregating, and statistics Calculate basic statistics of multidimensional data arrays and the K-Means algorithms for unsupervised learning Create more advanced regular expressions using grouping and named groups, negative lookaheads, escaped characters, whitespaces, character sets (and negative characters sets), and greedy/nongreedy operators Understand a wide range of computer science topics, including anagrams, palindromes, supersets, permutations, factorials, prime numbers, Fibonacci numbers, obfuscation, searching, and algorithmic sorting By the end of the book, you\\'ll know how to write Python at its most refined, and create concise, beautiful pieces of \"Python art\" in merely a single line.',\n",

       "     'description': 'Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is no doubt one of the hottest buzz words at the moment. AI has penetrated into many aspects of our lives. To know AI and to be able to use AI will bring enormous benefits to our work and life. However, to learn AI is a daunting task for many people, largely due to the complex mathematics and sophisticated coding. This book aims to demystify AI and teach readers about AI from scratch, by using simple, plain, languages and simple, illustrative, code examples. This book is divided into three parts. In part one, readers will follow an easy to read introduction about AI, including the history, the types of AI, the current status and possible future trend. It then introduces Python, A widely used programming tool for AI. In part two, we introduce Machine Learning aspect of AI, topics include classifications, regressions, and Clustering. It also includes the most popular Reinforcement Learning. In part three, it introduces Deep Learning aspect of AI, topics include Image Classifications, Transfer Learning, Recurrent Neural Network, and the latest Generative Adversarial Networks. It also includes the state of the art of GPU, TPU, cloud computing and edge computing. This book is packed with interesting and exciting examples such as pattern recognitions, image classifications, face recognition (most controversial), age and gender detection, voice/speech recognition, chatbot, natural language processing, translation, sentiment analysis, predictive maintenance, finance and stock price analysis, sales prediction, customer segmentation, biomedical data analysis and much more.',\n",

Agile comms is a set of simple techniques for bringing work and comms closer together - it helps teams communicate about work, as it happens. Giles Turnbull has worked with lots of teams in government and the private sector, helping them bring a more accessible, human tone to their communication material. This book brings together the things he's learned along the way. Agile comms isn't the same as content design, but the two ideas have a lot in common. This book is useful for content designers, product owners, delivery managers, user researchers, comms professionals, strategists, founders, digital transformation professionals and senior leaders. It's lively, accessible, readable and short. There are tea-related jokes.\",\n",

       "     'description': \"There's a great deal of excitement surrounding the use of Linux in embedded systems -- for everything from cell phones to car ABS systems and water-filtration plants -- but not a lot of practical information. Building Embedded Linux Systems offers an in-depth, hard-core guide to putting together embedded systems based on Linux. Updated for the latest version of the Linux kernel, this new edition gives you the basics of building embedded Linux systems, along with the configuration, setup, and use of more than 40 different open source and free software packages in common use. The book also looks at the strengths and weaknesses of using Linux in an embedded system, plus a discussion of licensing issues, and an introduction to real-time, with a discussion of real-time options for Linux. This indispensable book features arcane and previously undocumented procedures for: Building your own GNU development toolchain Using an efficient embedded development framework Selecting, configuring, building, and installing a target-specific kernel Creating a complete target root filesystem Setting up, manipulating, and using solid-state storage devices Installing and configuring a bootloader for the target Cross-compiling a slew of utilities and packages Debugging your embedded system using a plethora of tools and techniques Using the uClibc, BusyBox, U-Boot, OpenSSH, thttpd, tftp, strace, and gdb packages By presenting how to build the operating system components from pristine sources and how to find more documentation or help, Building Embedded Linux Systems greatly simplifies the task of keeping complete control over your embedded operating system.\",\n",

What You Will Learn Build programs with the right architectural attributes Use Enterprise Architectural Patterns to solve scalable problems on the Web Understand design patterns from a Python perspective Optimize the performance testing tools in Python Deploy code in remote environments or on the Cloud using Python Secure architecture applications in Python In Detail This book starts off by explaining how Python fits into an application architecture. As you move along, you will understand the architecturally significant demands and how to determine them. Later, you'll get a complete understanding of the different architectural quality requirements that help an architect to build a product that satisfies business needs, such as maintainability/reusability, testability, scalability, performance, usability, and security. You will use various techniques such as incorporating DevOps, Continuous Integration, and more to make your application robust. You will understand when and when not to use object orientation in your applications. You will be able to think of the future and design applications that can scale proportionally to the growing business. The focus is on building the business logic based on the business process documentation and which frameworks are to be used when. We also cover some important patterns that are to be taken into account while solving design problems as well as those in relatively new domains such as the Cloud. This book will help you understand the ins and outs of Python so that you can make those critical design decisions that not just live up to but also surpass the expectations of your clients. Style and approach Filled with examples and use cases, this guide takes a no-nonsense approach to help you with everything it takes to become a successful software architect.\",\n",

This book uses a realistic approach to help get you started designing and building the applications you need while learning new tools along the way. PyQt has a vast collection of tools that you can use to create GUIs, many of which seem to go unexplored. In Modern PyQt, you will go beyond some of the fundamental topics of GUI development in order to begin building useful desktop applications. Through extensive examples and hands-on projects, you will explore how to make applications for data analysis and visualization using graphs, computer vision with OpenCV and PyQt, the basics of networking, handling databases with SQL, and more! Whether you are looking for new ideas to practice your skills as a programmer or you have a specific goal in mind and need some help to get your ideas off the ground, there is something in Modern PyQt for you! What You Will Learn Create cross-platform GUIs with Python and PyQt. Understand the important PyQt classes, widgets, and concepts needed for building interactive and practical applications. Find out how to embed useful Python modules into your applications to create more advanced GUIs. Build useful applications that you can improve or make into something completely new with Python and PyQt. Who This Book Is For Intermediate level programmers or above in Python. GUI developers with some experience designing GUIs. Even if they have never used PyQt before, the concepts learned from other toolkits, such as Tkinter or wxPython, can be carried over for developing applications with using PyQt.',\n",

If you’ve been curious about artificial intelligence and machine learning but didn’t know where to start, this is the book you’ve been waiting for. Focusing on the subfield of machine learning known as deep learning, it explains core concepts and gives you the foundation you need to start building your own models. Rather than simply outlining recipes for using existing toolkits, Practical Deep Learning teaches you the why of deep learning and will inspire you to explore further. All you need is basic familiarity with computer programming and high school math—the book will cover the rest. After an introduction to Python, you’ll move through key topics like how to build a good training dataset, work with the scikit-learn and Keras libraries, and evaluate your models’ performance. You’ll also learn: How to use classic machine learning models like k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines How neural networks work and how they’re trained How to use convolutional neural networks How to develop a successful deep learning model from scratch You’ll conduct experiments along the way, building to a final case study that incorporates everything you’ve learned. The perfect introduction to this dynamic, ever-expanding field, Practical Deep Learning will give you the skills and confidence to dive into your own machine learning projects.',\n",

Until the early 1990s, when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, travelling behind the iron curtain was never easy. In undertaking his new journey through Eastern Europe, breathing in its rich history, and exquisite sights and talking to its diverse peoples, Michael fills what has been a void in his own experience and that of very many others. NEW EUROPE is very much a voyage of discovery, from the snows of the Julian Alps to the beauty of the Baltic sea, he finds himself in countries he'd barely heard of, many unfamiliar and mysterious, all with tragic histories and much brighter futures. During his 20-country adventure Palin meets Romanian lumberjacks, drives the 8.58 stopping train from Poznan to Wolsztyn, treads the catwalk at a Budapest fashion show, learns about mine-clearing in Bosnia and watches Turkish gents wrestling in olive oil. As with all his bestselling books, in his uniquely entertaining style, Palin opens up a new and undiscovered world to millions of readers.\",\n",

       "     'description': \"Since Plato, Western critics of literature have asked how it is possible for fiction writers to mean something serious. The outrage over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, published in 1988, highlighted our continued uneasiness over distinctions between fact and fiction, novel and history, truth and falsehood. The blasphemy charged against Rushdie raises important questions: Did Rushdie mean The Satanic Verses, or didn't he? When he publicly recanted, what did he mean? What do we even mean by mean? This is the starting point for Richard Henry's fascinating investigation of the pragmatic foundations of fictional discourse. Drawing from Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature, Henry offers a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts. Pretending and Meaning: Toward a Pragmatic Theory of Fictional Discourse draws upon Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature to offer a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts.\",\n",

It's about doing cool stuff with syndication feeds-making the technology give you exactly what you want the way you want. It's about building a feed aggregator and routing feeds to your e-mail or iPod, producing and hosting feeds, filtering, sifting, and blending them, and much more. Tan-talizing loose ends beg you to create more hacks the author hasn't thought up yet. Because if you can't have fun with the technology, what's the point? A sampler platter of things you'll learn to do Build a simple feed aggregator Add feeds to your buddy list Tune into rich media feeds with BitTorrent Monitor system logs and events with feeds Scrape feeds from old-fashioned Web sites Reroute mailing lists into your aggregator Distill popular links from blogs Republish feed headlines on your Web site Extend feeds using calendar events and microformats\",\n",

And (2) there\\'s this book. It\\'s not a \"tell me all about it\" it\\'s a \"show me how to do it\" book. Award-winning author Scott Kelby shows you step-by-step how it\\'s all done, using the same casual, plain English style that made him one of the world\\'s bestselling technology authors. You\\'ll learn how to do only the most important, most requested, and just plain cool things you\\'re going to want to do with your iPod so you can start having fun with it today. Right now! Each page covers just one topic, complete with full color photos making it easy to find just what you\\'re looking for fast. Plus, it shows you how to get the most from the iTunes Music Store, how to integrate your iPod into your car, which iPod accessories are hot, and there\\'s even entire chapters on using Apple iPod photo and the new iPod shuffle! It\\'s all here in the only book of its kind, and you\\'re gonna love it!',\n",

       "     'description': 'Leverage Python for expert-level volatility and variance derivative trading Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives is a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of these increasingly popular derivatives products, and has the distinction of being both the first to cover European volatility and variance products provided by Eurex and the first to offer Python code for implementing comprehensive quantitative analyses of these financial products. For those who want to get started right away, the book is accompanied by a dedicated Web page and a Github repository that includes all the code from the book for easy replication and use, as well as a hosted version of all the code for immediate execution. Python is fast making inroads into financial modelling and derivatives analytics, and recent developments allow Python to be as fast as pure C++ or C while consisting generally of only 10% of the code lines associated with the compiled languages. This complete guide offers rare insight into the use of Python to undertake complex quantitative analyses of listed volatility and variance derivatives. Learn how to use Python for data and financial analysis, and reproduce stylised facts on volatility and variance markets Gain an understanding of the fundamental techniques of modelling volatility and variance and the model-free replication of variance Familiarise yourself with micro structure elements of the markets for listed volatility and variance derivatives Reproduce all results and graphics with IPython/Jupyter Notebooks and Python codes that accompany the book Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives is the complete guide to Python-based quantitative analysis of these Eurex derivatives products.',\n",

       "     'description': \"Do less work when testing your Python code, but be just as expressive, just as elegant, and just as readable. The pytest testing framework helps you write tests quickly and keep them readable and maintainable - with no boilerplate code. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it's just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing for applications, packages, and libraries. This book shows you how. For Python-based projects, pytest is the undeniable choice to test your code if you're looking for a full-featured, API-independent, flexible, and extensible testing framework. With a full-bodied fixture model that is unmatched in any other tool, the pytest framework gives you powerful features such as assert rewriting and plug-in capability - with no boilerplate code. With simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn and robust tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing. Add powerful testing features and still speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use the built-in assert statements to reduce false test failures by separating setup and test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, unittest, and doctest. Write simple, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing and why. What You Need: The examples in this book are written using Python 3.6 and pytest 3.0. However, pytest 3.0 supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and Python 3.3-3.6.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'With a worldwide community of users and more than a million dedicated programmers, Perl has proven to be the most effective language for the latest trends in computing and business. Every programmer must keep up with the latest tools and techniques. This updated version of Advanced Perl Programming from O\\'Reilly gives you the essential knowledge of the modern Perl programmer. Whatever your current level of Perl expertise, this book will help you push your skills to the next level and become a more accomplished programmer. O\\'Reilly\\'s most high-level Perl tutorial to date, Advanced Perl Programming, Second Edition teaches you all the complex techniques for production-ready Perl programs. This completely updated guide clearly explains concepts such as introspection, overriding built-ins, extending Perl\\'s object-oriented model, and testing your code for greater stability. Other topics include: Complex data structures Parsing Templating toolkits Working with natural language data Unicode Interaction with C and other languages In addition, this guide demystifies once complex topics like object-relational mapping and event-based development-arming you with everything you need to completely upgrade your skills. Praise for the Second Edition: \"Sometimes the biggest hurdle to problem solving isn\\'t the subject itself but rather the sheer number of modules Perl provides. Advanced Perl Programming walks you through Perl\\'s TMTOWTDI (\"There\\'s More Than One Way To Do It\") forest, explaining and comparing the best modules for each task so you can intelligently apply them in a variety of situations.\" --Rocco Caputo, lead developer of POE \"It has been said that sufficiently advanced Perl code is indistinguishable from magic. This book of spells goes a long way to unlocking those secrets. It has the power to transform the most humble programmer into a Perl wizard.\" --Andy Wardley \"The information here isn\\'t theoretical. It presents tools and techniques for solving real problems cleanly and elegantly.\" --Curtis \\'Ovid\\' Poe \" Advanced Perl Programming collects hard-earned knowledge from some of the best programmers in the Perl community, and explains it in a way that even novices can apply immediately.\" --chromatic, Editor of Perl.com',\n",

       "     'description': \"The snake is one of humankind's most powerful and ambiguous symbols: it has at various times represented immortality and death, male and female, deity and demon, circle and line, killer and healer, the highest wisdom and the deepest subconscious. By virtue of its mysterious movement, potent poison, fearful grip, unblinking gaze and lightning quick strike, the power and image of the snake has wound its way into every culture. Whether snakes are worshipped as gods, feared as devils, or handled in religious ceremonies to test faith, snakes have played a critical role in the human heritage. This book explores the cult of the snake in world history, religion, and folklore. Fascination with snakes has been around since the dawn of time. Even today, images of snakes attract attention, fear, disgust, or admiration. Morgan examines that obsession with this mysterious creature, covering in vivid details such topics as mythical snakes like the Plumed Serpent, serpent iconography, tall tales, as well as the psychological symbolism that has attached itself to snakes. Cultures as diverse as pre-Columbian America, India, Egypt, China, sub-Saharan Africa, Celtic Europe, and the United States have all accorded the serpent a special place in their culture—apparently regardless of whether or not real snakes play an important part in the life of the people. Here, the mysterious nature of the snake unfolds, enchanting readers with a colorful and lively discussion of its place in our history, stories, religions, and cultures.\",\n",

Most software developers waste thousands of hours working with overly complex code. The eight core principles in The Art of Clean Coding will teach you how to write clear, maintainable code without compromising functionality. The book’s guiding principle is simplicity: reduce and simplify, then reinvest energy in the important parts to save you countless hours and ease the often onerous task of code maintenance. Bestselling author Christian Mayer leverages his experience helping thousands perfect their coding skills in this new book. With expert advice and real-world examples, he’ll show you how to: Concentrate on the important stuff with the 80/20 principle -- focus on the 20% of your code that matters most Avoid coding in isolation: create a minimum viable product to get early feedback Write code cleanly and simply to eliminate clutter Avoid premature optimization that risks over-complicating code Balance your goals, capacity, and feedback to achieve the productive state of Flow Apply the Do One Thing Well philosophy to vastly improve functionality Design efficient user interfaces with the Less is More principle Tie your new skills together into one unifying principle: Focus The Python-based The Art of Clean Coding is suitable for programmers at any level, with ideas presented in a language-agnostic manner.',\n",

The world runs on code written in the C programming language, yet most schools begin the curriculum with Python or Java. Effective C bridges this gap and brings C into the modern era--covering the modern C17 Standard as well as potential C2x features. With the aid of this instant classic, you'll soon be writing professional, portable, and secure C programs to power robust systems and solve real-world problems. Robert C. Seacord introduces C and the C Standard Library while addressing best practices, common errors, and open debates in the C community. Developed together with other C Standards committee experts, Effective C will teach you how to debug, test, and analyze C programs. You'll benefit from Seacord's concise explanations of C language constructs and behaviors, and from his 40 years of coding experience. You'll learn: How to identify and handle undefined behavior in a C program The range and representations of integers and floating-point values How dynamic memory allocation works and how to use nonstandard functions How to use character encodings and types How to perform I/O with terminals and filesystems using C Standard streams and POSIX file descriptors How to understand the C compiler's translation phases and the role of the preprocessor How to test, debug, and analyze C programs Effective C will teach you how to write professional, secure, and portable C code that will stand the test of time and help strengthen the foundation of the computing world.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'This book is a complete introduction to the power of R for marketing research practitioners. The text describes statistical models from a conceptual point of view with a minimal amount of mathematics, presuming only an introductory knowledge of statistics. Hands-on chapters accelerate the learning curve by asking readers to interact with R from the beginning. Core topics include the R language, basic statistics, linear modeling, and data visualization, which is presented throughout as an integral part of analysis. Later chapters cover more advanced topics yet are intended to be approachable for all analysts. These sections examine logistic regression, customer segmentation, hierarchical linear modeling, market basket analysis, structural equation modeling, and conjoint analysis in R. The text uniquely presents Bayesian models with a minimally complex approach, demonstrating and explaining Bayesian methods alongside traditional analyses for analysis of variance, linear models, and metric and choice-based conjoint analysis. With its emphasis on data visualization, model assessment, and development of statistical intuition, this book provides guidance for any analyst looking to develop or improve skills in R for marketing applications.',\n",

It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https: //www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. For a description of standard objects and modules, see library-index. reference-index gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read extending-index and c-api-index. There are also several books covering Python in depth. This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language's flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in library-index.\",\n",

Go Hack Yourself is an eye-opening, hands-on introduction to the world of hacking, from an award-winning cybersecurity coach. As you perform common attacks against yourself, you’ll be shocked by how easy they are to carry out—and realize just how vulnerable most people really are. You’ll be guided through setting up a virtual hacking lab so you can safely try out attacks without putting yourself or others at risk. Then step-by-step instructions will walk you through executing every major type of attack, including physical access hacks, Google hacking and reconnaissance, social engineering and phishing, malware, password cracking, web hacking, and phone hacking. You’ll even hack a virtual car! You’ll experience each hack from the point of view of both the attacker and the target. Most importantly, every hack is grounded in real-life examples and paired with practical cyber defense tips, so you’ll understand how to guard against the hacks you perform. You’ll learn: How to practice hacking within a safe, virtual environment How to use popular hacking tools the way real hackers do, like Kali Linux, Metasploit, and John the Ripper How to infect devices with malware, steal and crack passwords, phish for sensitive information, and more How to use hacking skills for good, such as to access files on an old laptop when you can’t remember the password Valuable strategies for protecting yourself from cyber attacks You can’t truly understand cyber threats or defend against them until you’ve experienced them firsthand. By hacking yourself before the bad guys do, you’ll gain the knowledge you need to keep you and your loved ones safe.',\n",

Regression, a Friendly Guide teaches you to build, assess, and interpret regression models. In each chapter, new modelling paradigms are introduced with simple language and illustrative examples. You’ll steadily build up your theoretical understanding until you can intuitively interpret abstract regression models and their underlying mathematics. Start off by building linear and logistic regression models with one or more variables, and master regression for count models. Learn to use simulation methods to assess your models, and discover advanced techniques like generalized additive models, penalty methods, and quantile regression. You’ll even learn how to interpret your models and findings for non-technical coworkers, to ensure your whole organization is making reliable decisions driven by accurate analysis. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.',\n",

       "     'description': 'The Hardware Hacking Handbook takes you deep inside embedded devices to show how different kinds of attacks work, then guides you through each hack on real hardware. Embedded devices are chip-size microcomputers small enough to be included in the structure of the object they control, and they’re everywhere—in phones, cars, credit cards, laptops, medical equipment, even critical infrastructure. This means understanding their security is critical. The Hardware Hacking Handbook takes you deep inside different types of embedded systems, revealing the designs, components, security limits, and reverse-engineering challenges you need to know for executing effective hardware attacks. Written with wit and infused with hands-on lab experiments, this handbook puts you in the role of an attacker interested in breaking security to do good. Starting with a crash course on the architecture of embedded devices, threat modeling, and attack trees, you’ll go on to explore hardware interfaces, ports and communication protocols, electrical signaling, tips for analyzing firmware images, and more. Along the way, you’ll use a home testing lab to perform fault-injection, side-channel (SCA), and simple and differential power analysis (SPA/DPA) attacks on a variety of real devices, such as a crypto wallet. The authors also share insights into real-life attacks on embedded systems, including Sony’s PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and Philips Hue lights, and provide an appendix of the equipment needed for your hardware hacking lab – like a multimeter and an oscilloscope – with options for every type of budget. You’ll learn: How to model security threats, using attacker profiles, assets, objectives, and countermeasures Electrical basics that will help you understand communication interfaces, signaling, and measurement How to identify injection points for executing clock, voltage, electromagnetic, laser, and body-biasing fault attacks, as well as practical injection tips How to use timing and power analysis attacks to extract passwords and cryptographic keys Techniques for leveling up both simple and differential power analysis, from practical measurement tips to filtering, processing, and visualization Whether you’re an industry engineer tasked with understanding these attacks, a student starting out in the field, or an electronics hobbyist curious about replicating existing work, The Hardware Hacking Handbook is an indispensable resource – one you’ll always want to have onhand.',\n",

This book shows you tools and techniques that you can apply to clean and handle data with Python. You'll begin by getting familiar with the shape of data by using practices that can be deployed routinely with most data sources. Then, the book teaches you how to manipulate data to get it into a useful form. You'll also learn how to filter and summarize data to gain insights and better understand what makes sense and what does not, along with discovering how to operate on data to address the issues you've identified. Moving on, you'll perform key tasks, such as handling missing values, validating errors, removing duplicate data, monitoring high volumes of data, and handling outliers and invalid dates. Next, you'll cover recipes on using supervised learning and Naive Bayes analysis to identify unexpected values and classification errors, and generate visualizations for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize unexpected values. Finally, you'll build functions and classes that you can reuse without modification when you have new data. By the end of this Python book, you'll be equipped with all the key skills that you need to clean data and diagnose problems within it.

Linux for the Superuser Unlike some operating systems, Linux doesn’t try to hide the important bits from you—it gives you full control of your computer. But to truly master Linux, you need to understand its internals, like how the system boots, how networking works, and what the kernel actually does. In this third edition of the bestselling How Linux Works, author Brian Ward peels back the layers of this well-loved operating system to make Linux internals accessible. This edition has been thoroughly updated and expanded with added coverage of Logical Volume Manager (LVM), virtualization, and containers. You'll learn: How Linux boots, from boot loaders to init (systemd) How the kernel manages devices, device drivers, and processes How networking, interfaces, firewalls, and servers work How development tools work and relate to shared libraries How to write effective shell scripts You’ll also explore the kernel and examine key system tasks inside user-space processes, including system calls, input and output, and filesystem maintenance. With its combination of background, theory, real-world examples, and thorough explanations, How Linux Works, 3rd Edition will teach you what you need to know to take control of your operating system. NEW TO THIS EDITION: Hands-on coverage of the LVM, journald logging system, and IPv6 Additional chapter on virtualization, featuring containers and cgroups Expanded discussion of systemd Covers systemd-based installations\",\n",

Over 450 pages of essentials skills and ideas every developer should know with illustrations by the author, who loves to sketch. An illustrated CS Primer, if you will. Rob is a self-taught software developer (like so many) and for most of his career he learned what was required to get the job done. When conversations veered toward core concepts, he disengaged. Rob decided to change all of this in 2014. He sat down and looked up all of the topics that a typical CS degree covers and then dove in. Half way through, he decided to write a book about what he was learning. That book is The Imposter's Handbook, a compendium of useful programming concepts from Algorithms to Complexity Theory, TDD to Garbage Collection. Things you should really know if you're paid to write software.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'One of the attractive aspects of C++ is that it offers good facilities for object-oriented programming (OOP), but, as a hybrid language, it also supports procedural programming. The significance of this for programmers is that it offers more flexibility allowing them to shift to object-oriented programming if and when they feel the need to do so. In this regard, C++ differs from some purely object-oriented languages, such as Smalltalk, Eiffel and Java. This book offers practical guidance on how to programme in both styles. The C++ language and its standard library have gone through a good many improvements and extensions during their evolution. This third edition has therefore been completely revised in accordance with the C++ language revision, which is embodied in the ANSI/ISO C++ Standard. For example, the new, important type string is used throughout the book and the Standard Template Library (STL) is introduced to readers at an early stage and discussed in more detail later on. All example programs and the solutions to the exercises can be downloaded from the website. http://home.wxs.nl/ ~ammeraal/ Solutions for some of these exercises can be found in the appendix.',\n",

No prior experience of writing microservices in Python is assumed.What You Will Learn* Explore what microservices are and how to design them* Use Python 3, Flask, Tox, and other tools to build your services using best practices* Learn how to use a TDD approach* Discover how to document your microservices* Configure and package your code in the best way* Interact with other services* Secure, monitor, and scale your services* Deploy your services in Docker containers, CoreOS, and Amazon Web ServicesIn DetailWe often deploy our web applications into the cloud, and our code needs to interact with many third-party services. An efficient way to build applications to do this is through microservices architecture. But, in practice, it's hard to get this right due to the complexity of all the pieces interacting with each other.This book will teach you how to overcome these issues and craft applications that are built as small standard units, using all the proven best practices and avoiding the usual traps. It's a practical book: you'll build everything using Python 3 and its amazing tooling ecosystem. You will understand the principles of TDD and apply them.You will use Flask, Tox, and other tools to build your services using best practices. You will learn how to secure connections between services, and how to script Nginx using Lua to build web application firewall features such as rate limiting. You will also familiarize yourself with Docker's role in microservices, and use Docker containers, CoreOS, and Amazon Web Services to deploy your services.This book will take you on a journey, ending with the creation of a complete Python application based on microservices. By the end of the book, you will be well versed with the fundamentals of building, designing, testing, and deploying your Python microservices.Style and approachThis book is an linear, easy-to-follow guide on how to best design, write, test, and deploy your microservices.
